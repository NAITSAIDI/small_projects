      "That was it? I was married? Just like that?\n",

      "After a brief hesitation and another look at our\n",
      "receptionist, she followed me toward my oﬀice in silence.\n",
      "After a long walk, I opened the glass door for her to step\n",
      "in. I reminded Cynthia, my assistant, not to forward any\n",
      "calls, and then I waited until Rose was settled in her seat.\n",
      "Holding her bulky brown  handbag on her lap, she gave me\n",
      "an expectant look as I took my own seat behind my desk.\n",
      "“I thought the Colesons’ lawyer was Tim Reeves, at least\n",

      "before I could utter a word.\n",
      "“No, Miss Coleson. Tim is the one who drafted the will,\n",

      "maybe? Or tea?”\n",

      "I raised an eyebrow . This was something I already  knew\n",

      "every detail. “That’s right. I apologize.”\n",
      "“That’s okay… I just wanted to mention it in case you\n",
      "weren’t alrea dy aware. I’m afraid it’s also the reason why I\n",

      "want to talk to me about.”\n",
      "This wasn’t going like I had planned. Granted, I hadn’t\n",
      "given how I wanted to do this much thought, but it was still\n",
      "not going smoothly enough.\n",
      "“I read the will,” I admitt ed after taking in the stiﬀ way\n",
      "she was holding herself: sitting on the very edge of her\n",
      "seat, impatient and ready  to bolt. Maybe she’d appreciate a\n",
      "more straigh tforward approach, which was something I\n",
      "excelled at.\n",
      "“Okay ,” she prompted, raising an eyebrow .\n",

      "Her shoulders stiﬀened. “ What about it?”\n",
      "“I’d like to know what your plan is going forward\n",

      "contract a little while before his death indicating that you\n",
      "would have use of the property for a short time period,\n",
      "something like two years, and would only pay him a small\n",
      "amount of rent instead of the actual worth of the place. At\n",
      "the end of the two years, you would relocate. Correct?”\n",
      "She frowned at me but nodded.\n",
      "Satisﬁed that she was following me, I continued, “The\n",
      "contract was entered into the will, but Gary chose to add a stipulation I believe you only recently learned about. In the\n",
      "case of something happening to him during those two\n",
      "years, he wanted owners hip of the property to transfer to\n",
      "your husband—”\n",
      "“If I were married,” Rose ﬁnished, her chin held high.\n",
      "“Yes.” I pointedly looked at her left hand and she\n",

      "Her eyes lifted back to mine in the next second  and I\n",
      "watched a frown form between her brows.\n",
      "“I already know about all of this,” she explained slowly .\n",
      "“Gary was excited about me marrying Joshua, my ﬁancé.\n",
      "They got along well, and he liked him—we both had a\n",
      "business degree, but evidently it looked like he trusted\n",
      "Joshua more—”\n",
      "“Your ex-ﬁancé, you mean,” I reminded her .\n",
      "She paused at my words,  but her ﬁngers ﬁnally let go of\n",
      "the death grip she had on her handbag as she tried to\n",
      "follow my meaning. “Yes. Right. Of course, ex-ﬁancé. It’s\n",
      "still a habit. We only broke up a few weeks ago. I’m sorry ,\n",
      "but how do you know he’s my ex-ﬁancé?”\n",
      "I paused, trying to be careful with my words. “I do my\n",
      "due diligence, Miss Coleson. Please continue.”\n",
      "She studied me for a long moment as I waited patiently .\n",
      "“I wasn’t even aware that he would enter our contract into\n",
      "his will. I was also never supposed to have owners hip of the\n",
      "property , that wasn’t in the contract. He was letting me\n",
      "have use of the property for two years only, after  the time\n",
      "limit, I was to leave. Then my uncle and his wife, Angela,\n",
      "died in the car crash and I learned that in the will he was\n",
      "planning on leaving the property to my husband.”\n",
      "“Maybe that was his way of giving you something. A\n",
      "surprise maybe. A wedding gift of some kind.”\n",
      "“Yes. Maybe.  Maybe that was his way of leaving us the\n",
      "place, but I’m not marrie d to Joshua at the mome nt, am I?\n",
      "So I get nothing.” She shrugged. “I only knew that Gary\n",
      "thought Joshua’s presence would be necessary if I was serious about opening my own coﬀee shop. I disagreed with\n",
      "him. It didn’t matter that we’d started discussing the\n",
      "possibility of me using the space a year prior to Joshua\n",
      "even coming into my life. He didn’t think I could handle the\n",
      "work on my own, and Joshua was in between jobs so he\n",
      "thought it made sense. I didn’t. I believe he trusted Joshua\n",
      "more than he trusted me because he went to a better\n",
      "school. Also,  can’t forget about the fact that I’m a woman\n",
      "and Joshua is a man. He was old-fashioned and didn’t\n",
      "believe women could handle themselves in the business\n",
      "world. However , when we talked about it again and I told\n",
      "him about my plans for the place, he agreed to let me use\n",
      "his property . Joshua wasn ’t a part of the conversa tion then\n",
      "—or the contract, for that matter . He never made\n",
      "stipulations other than the fact that I’d only be able to use\n",
      "the space for two years and then I’d have to ﬁnd myself a\n",
      "diﬀerent location. That was all the help he was willing to\n",
      "give me. Nothing more, nothing less. I was thankful either\n",
      "way. I have no idea why he felt it was necessary to add\n",
      "Joshua in his will regarding something concerning me. And\n",
      "why am I telling you all this?”\n",
      "I leane d back in my seat, getting comfortable. Now we\n",
      "were getting somewhere. “He still isn’t part of the\n",
      "conversation.”\n",
      "“I… Excuse me?”\n",
      "“Gary never used your ex-ﬁancé’s name. He never\n",
      "speciﬁed who would be the owner of the property in case\n",
      "he passed away . There is only the mention of a ‘husband.’”\n",
      "“I don’t see how that matters. I was supposed to get\n",
      "married to Joshua sometime this year and he knew that, but\n",
      "in the end, I didn’t. Joshu a broke up with me two days after\n",
      "their death. So, because I’m not married, Mr. Hawthorne,\n",
      "and I’m not planning on marrying anyone any time soon, I\n",
      "don’t get to use the space let alone own it. I talked to my\n",
      "cousins, Bryan and Jodi, but they aren’t interested in\n",
      "honoring the contract I’d signed with their dad, which means I’m not going to be able to open my coﬀee shop. At\n",
      "this point, I’m just tryin g to accept the fact that I threw\n",
      "away ﬁfty thousand dollars—ﬁfty thousand dollars that I\n",
      "managed to save by working for I don’t even know how\n",
      "many years at this point—on a space that was never going\n",
      "to be mine anyway . All that aside, I lost two people who\n",
      "were importa nt to me in the same car crash that day. Even\n",
      "though I was Gary’s niece, they never saw me as their own\n",
      "ﬂesh and blood, but they were all I had after my dad passed\n",
      "away when I was nine. Whatever the case may be, instead\n",
      "of letting me get lost in the system Gary agreed to take me\n",
      "in and that’s all that matters. So, to answer your previous\n",
      "question, I have no plans regarding the property because\n",
      "I’m not allowed to use it anymore.”\n",
      "A little out of breath and, from what I could tell, a lot\n",
      "pissed oﬀ, she stood up and hooked her bag over her\n",
      "shoulder .\n",
      "“Okay , I really don’t want to be rude, but I believe this\n",
      "was a waste of both our time. I was a little curiou s when I\n",
      "was following you here, I’ll admit that much, but I don’t\n",
      "have time to go over things I already know for no reason at\n",
      "all. I have a job interview  I need to get to, and I can’t aﬀord\n",

      "meeting you, Mr . Hawthorne.”\n",
      "Thinking our conversatio n was done, she extended her\n",
      "hand over my desk, and I stared at it for a secon d. Before\n",
      "she could decide to walk away , I let out a breath, rose from\n",
      "my seat, and looked into her eyes as I took her hand.\n",
      "This was it. This was the part where I should’ve said It\n",
      "was nice meeting you and gone on with my day . I didn’t.\n",
      "In a calm and collected voice, I said what I’d been\n",
      "waiting to say. “You’re not being rude, Miss Coleson, but\n",
      "before you go, I’d like you to marry me.” Breaking our\n",
      "connection, I pushed my hands into my pockets, watching\n",
      "for her reaction. After a short moment of hesitation, she replied, “Sure,\n",
      "how about we do that after my job interview , but before\n",
      "dinner . Beca use, you know , I already made plans with Tom\n",
      "Hardy and I don’t think I can postpone—”\n",
      "“Are you mocking me?” I stood absolutely still.\n",
      "Her narrowed eyes moved across my face, searching for\n",
      "an answer , I presumed. When she couldn’t ﬁnd what she\n",
      "was looking for, the ﬁght went out of her, and right in front\n",
      "of my eyes, her entire demeanor—which had hardened the\n",
      "second I’d started asking questions about her ex-ﬁancé—\n",
      "softened and she puﬀed out a breath.\n",
      "“You weren’t making a bad joke?”\n",
      "“Do I look like someone who jokes?”\n",
      "Making a noncommittal sound, she shifted in place. “At\n",
      "ﬁrst glance…I can’t say that you do, but I don’t know you\n",
      "enough to be sure.”\n",
      "“I’ll save you the trouble—I don’t make jokes.”\n",
      "She gave me a baﬄed look like I had said something\n",
      "astonishing. “O -kay. I think I’m still going to leave now .”\n",
      "Just like that, she surpr ised me and turned away to\n",
      "leave. Before she could open the door , I spoke up.\n",
      "“You’re not interested in hearing more about my oﬀer\n",
      "then?”\n",
      "Her hand was already on the glass knob when she\n",
      "stopped. With stiﬀ shoulders, she let go of the door and\n",
      "turned to face me.\n",
      "After opening and closing her mouth, she looked straight\n",
      "into my eyes from across the room. “Your oﬀer? Just so\n",
      "we’re on the same page and I can make sure I didn’t hear\n",
      "you wrong, could you repeat said oﬀer?”\n",
      "“I’m oﬀering to marry you.”\n",
      "Hiking her bag higher on her shoulder , she cleared her\n",

      "you’d—”\n",
      "“Miss Coleson,” I cut her oﬀ bluntly before she could\n",
      "ﬁnish her sentence. “I assure you, my marriage  oﬀer is strictly a business  deal. I’m sure you’re not thinking I’m\n",

      "that you could use my help—was I wrong?”\n",
      "“Your help? I don’t even know you, and I deﬁnitely don’t\n",

      "understanding, I could help you.”\n",
      "“How about everything? From where I’m standin g, that\n",
      "sounds like a good place to start.”\n",
      "“Right, of course. If you’ll take your seat, I’d be thrilled\n",
      "to go into more details. For example, I can make sure your\n",
      "life savings, which you already spent on a coﬀee shop that’s\n",
      "not happenin g, won’t go to waste.” I was gues sing she\n",

      "“How do you know that was my life s—”\n",
      "“Like I said before, I do my—”\n",
      "“Due diligence, right. I heard you the ﬁrst time.” She\n",
      "looked out, her eyes scanning the busy hallway outside my\n",

      "walking out and staying. Then, reluctantly , she moved back\n",
      "toward my desk and me, and equally as reluctantly sat\n",
      "down on the edge of the seat again. Her untrusting eyes\n",

      "staying, I’d like you to consider my oﬀer .”\n",
      "Brieﬂy closing her eyes, she took a deep breath and let it\n",
      "all out. “See, that’s not really explaining anythin g to me.\n",
      "You keep asking the same thing, and I keep experiencing\n",
      "the same urge to get up and leave.” “I’d like us to get married for a number of reasons, but\n",
      "the one that would intere st you most is the fact that you’d\n",
      "get to open your coﬀee shop on Madison A venue.”\n",
      "When she didn’t make any comments, we remained\n",
      "silent.\n",

      "“Sounds like you understood me well enough.”\n",
      "After another baﬄed look, she leaned back in her seat\n",
      "then got up, dumped her handbag on the chair , and walked\n",
      "over to the ﬂoor-to-ceiling windows to gaze at the skyline. A\n",
      "whole minute passed in silence, and my patience started to\n",
      "wear thin.\n",
      "“You’re insane then,” she said. “Are you insane, Mr.\n",
      "Hawthorne?”\n",
      "“I’m not going to answer that question,” I replied\n",
      "tersely .\n",

      "arms and dropped them. “That simple? Could you be\n",
      "helpful right  now and explain further , please? You want to\n",
      "help me, for some insane reason—me, some one who\n",

      "“You’re the ﬁrst, Miss Coleson.”\n",
      "“So, I’m the special snowﬂake.”\n",
      "“In a way , yes.” Turning back to the view, she dropped her head and\n",
      "rubbed her temples. “ Why?”\n",
      "“Are you asking me why you’re a special snowﬂake?”\n",
      "Snorting, she glanced at me over her shoulder . “No, I’m\n",
      "not asking you… Can you give me more information,\n",
      "please? Like actual sentences that explain things and\n",
      "actually makes sense? I’m pretty sure you’re not asking me\n",
      "to marry you just to help me out. What’s in it for you? What\n",
      "are all those reasons you mentioned?” She looked around\n",
      "my oﬀice, taking everything in, me included —all the\n",

      "“You’re right, I don’t need money . Like I said before, this\n",

      "“You’re awfully sure of yourself while I’m still trying to\n",

      "I ignored her assessment and continued. “It’ll be nothing\n",

      "Crossing her arms agains t her chest, she faced me, and\n",
      "we looked at each other . I couldn’t even begin to guess\n",
      "what was going through her mind. My own damn mind,\n",
      "however , was at war with my conscience. “Why not marry someone you love? Someone you’re\n",

      "consider asking me? You know nothing about me. We’re\n",
      "nothing but two strangers.” Seemingly trying to hold back\n",
      "her emotions, she took a deep breath. “Call me old-\n",
      "fashioned, Mr. Hawthorne, but I’m a romantic. I believe in\n",
      "marrying someone for love and only for love. Marriage is…\n",
      "Marriage means  something completely diﬀerent to me than\n",

      "I was married my husband would own the property , that’s\n",
      "what the will says. So if you’re my husband…” She paused\n",
      "and then shrugged. “I get that you’re after the property as\n",
      "well, but I’m still waitin g to hear about the part where\n",
      "you’d help me. So far all I’ve heard is you getting\n",

      "but when I was asked to read the will to advise on a few\n",
      "subjects, I found out about your situation and thought we\n",
      "could help each other out. To expand on another thing you\n",
      "mentioned, we’re not complete strangers. We did meet\n",
      "before—once, a year ago. It was just a brief encounter at\n",
      "one of your uncle’s partie s, but it still helped me put a face\n",
      "to your name. As vague as it was, I had an idea of who you\n",
      "are, and as for the rest…I had enough time to learn what I\n",
      "needed to learn about you, and I’m sure you’ll have the\n",

      "“We met? Where? I don’t remember .”\n",
      "Uncomfortable, I shifted in place and, not wanting  to go\n",
      "into too much detail, waved her question oﬀ. “If you don’t\n",
      "remember , there is no point in repeating it. Like I said, it\n",
      "was nothing more than a brief introduction anyway .\n",
      "Anything else you’d like to know?”\n",
      "“You’re genuinely being serious about this? Really?”\n",
      "I glanc ed at the clock on the wall. Time was wasting.\n",
      "“I’m not going to keep repeating myself , Miss Coleson. If\n",
      "you accept, we’ll get married and the property  will be\n",
      "transferred to me. After that, I’ll honor the initial contract\n",
      "terms and you can go ahead with your plans.”\n",
      "She sighed and seemed to mull my words over. “That’s\n",
      "it? That’s all? The property , attending events, and acting\n",
      "like we’re married in front of other people? Nothing more?”\n",
      "“That’s exactly it, and only for two years. Nothing more,\n",
      "nothing less.”\n",

      "this illegal? W ouldn’t it be illegal?”\n",
      "“Why would it be?” She gave me an exasperated look. “Fine. What about\n",
      "Jodi and Bryan? There is no way they’ll believe it was a real\n",
      "marriage. Can’t he dispute, challenge, or whatever it is\n",
      "people would do in this situation to stop me from opening\n",
      "the coﬀee shop and you having ownership?” With a frown\n",
      "on her face, she shook her head. “I’m not saying I’d do this,\n",

      "there would be blowbac k, for me or for you, I wouldn’t\n",
      "make this oﬀer. I’m the best at what I do, and no one will\n",

      "asking questions, which meant she was considering it. It\n",
      "was already a done deal. If I hadn’t already been sure of\n",
      "the outcome , I wouldn’t have come to her with the oﬀer.\n",

      "next appointment is here, Mr. Hawthorne, and you wanted\n",
      "me to inform you when the other meeting had started.”\n",

      "minutes here.”\n",
      "As Cynthia nodded and closed the door, Rose Coleson\n",
      "headed back  to her chair and picked up her bag. “I’m going to leave…and I’ll think about—”\n",

      "“Because as Cynthia just let us know , your cousins are in\n",
      "the meeting room at the moment, discussing how to handle\n",
      "the properties. If you accept my oﬀer, we’ll go join them\n",

      "last chance.”\n",
      "“You can’t really expect me to decide right now. Do you\n",

      "“And how would they know that? How would they know\n",
      "when or how we met?” I took my hands out of my pockets\n",

      "“Your point being?”\n",
      "“My point being?” Frustrated, she shook her head. “I\n",

      "Overwhelmed and looking confused, she dropped down\n",
      "on the chair . I felt like a bastard for forcing an answer from\n",

      "do them. If we were going to go forward with this, I needed\n",

      "that is. You don’t have to say yes, but when you do answer ,\n",
      "don’t forget that this is completely your own decision. I\n",
      "have nothing to lose in this. If I don’t end up with that\n",

      "you say the same?”\n",
      "Her hands resting on her lap, palms down on her jeans,\n",

      "“I think I’m quite clear on what you think of me.” Half\n",
      "sitting on my desk, I crossed my arms. “This will beneﬁt us\n",
      "both, Miss Coleson. If we sign that simple piece of paper\n",
      "that states we’re married , you’ll get to open up your coﬀee\n",
      "shop, and nothing else will change for two years. If we\n",
      "don’t, you’ll lose all your money on furniture and\n",
      "equipment you’ve bought  that you can’t use at the moment.\n",
      "From where I’m standing , there is no decision to make. I’m\n",
      "oﬀering you a lifeline. If you’re okay with losing all that, we\n",

      "“No, I guess we’re not. I completely agree with you, but\n",
      "then again, I believe it’s good enough for what we have in\n",
      "mind. If your answer is no, please let me know so I can get\n",
      "on with my next meeting.”\n",
      "Seconds ticked by as I waited for her answer , and I\n",
      "could see the exact mom ent her dream of opening her own\n",

      "would. “I can’t believe I’m saying this. I can’t even believe\n",

      "calling me Rose.”\n",
      "“Good. We’ll discuss the details at another date. In the\n",
      "meantime, I’ll draw up a marriage contract that covers everything.” Straightening from the desk, I crossed to the\n",

      "“Six months,” she blurted out.\n",

      "“Yes. I want you to give me six months before I start\n",

      "aﬀord it. And truth be told, I can’t. Sure, the rent I’ll be\n",
      "paying you is nothing for a place on Madison Avenue, but\n",
      "with everyth ing going on, I won’t be able to aﬀord it. But\n",
      "those rent-free six months will help me get a good start.”\n",
      "I studied her more closely . “You’re right, I can aﬀord not\n",

      "Paler than she’d been when she had ﬁrst entered my\n",

      "unsure.\n",

      "week, maybe? Maybe more? Why?”\n",
      "“Leave it to me.”\n",
      "We stepped in the room. Standing side by side. She had\n",

      "on her shoulder again.\n",
      "“Tim,” I interrupted and everyone in the room, including\n",

      "sorry for being late to the meeting.”\n",
      "Tim shuﬄed the pages he held in his hand, stood up and\n",
      "took oﬀ his glasses, his eyes on Rose. “Hello Jack. Miss\n",
      "Rose, I’m glad you could  join us. I won’t hold you for too\n",
      "long, we just need you to—”\n",
      "“Tim,” I said again and waited until his gaze met mine.\n",
      "“I thought you’d like to be informed so you can make the\n",

      "“What’s going on here?” he asked, his already hard gaze\n",
      "jumping from Rose to me. “Explain.”\n",
      "“Bryan, Jack and I are getting married.” She forced out\n",

      "—”\n",
      "“It sounds like you’re fucking with me, cuz.”\n",

      "I’ll let that one go, but I’d suggest you watch your words\n",
      "when you’re speaking to my ﬁancé.” I looked away from\n",
      "him and addressed the room. “I proposed to Rose last\n",

      "disappeared too and the door slid shut. Since we’d boarded\n",
      "the windows up, I couldn’t see outside, but I knew it was\n",
      "already dark. Reaching for my phone in my back pocket\n",
      "proved to be harder than I’d expected, but I was able to\n",

      "Left with no other choice, I slid down behind the counter ,\n",

      "Then it hit me again. If you ignored that I was dying a\n",
      "slow death from all kinds of aches, Sally was right—I was\n",
      "getting really close to the opening day. Ever since I had\n",
      "taken a job at a local coﬀee shop when I was eighteen, I\n",
      "knew I wanted to open my own place. Something that\n",
      "belonged just to me. Not only that, but it would  also be\n",
      "where I belonged. And that would be a ﬁrst as well. As\n",
      "cheesy as it sounded, there was something about the idea\n",
      "of my own place that had always lifted my heart when I\n",
      "daydreamed about it.\n",
      "Just as I felt myself drifting oﬀ, the front door opening\n",
      "and closing with a soft click jolted me awake. I had\n",
      "completely forgotten that I hadn’t locked it after Sally left.\n",
      "Thinking she had left something behind, I tried to get up.\n",
      "When my legs didn’t want to cooperate, I had to get on my\n",
      "hands and knees with much eﬀort and then held on to the\n",
      "counter to pull myself up.\n",
      "“What did you forget?” I asked, and it came out half as a\n",
      "groan and half as a whimper .\n",
      "Finding my cousin, Bryan , just on the other side of the\n",
      "counter was not the best surprise I could’ve wished for. At\n",
      "his unexpected appearance, I tried to come up with\n",
      "something to say, but I was completely tongue-tied. He\n",
      "tapped the counter with his knuckles and took a good look\n",
      "around. So far, I had ignored every single one of his calls\n",
      "and had even turned oﬀ my phone when his threatening\n",

      "obvious in his voice.\n",
      "“Bryan, I don’t think—” “Yes,” he interrupted, taking a step forward. “Yes, you\n",
      "don’t think. You didn’t think. I’m not going to let this go,\n",
      "Rose. Surely , that’s obvious. You don’t deserve this place.\n",
      "You’re not family , not really , you know that. You’ve always\n",
      "known that. And having that lawyer behind you will change\n",
      "nothing.” His gaze fell to my hands. “I see you’re not even\n",
      "wearing a wedding ring. Who do you think you’re fooling?”\n",
      "I gritted my teeth and balled my ﬁsts behin d the\n",

      "pleasure it would give me.\n",
      "“I’m working. I’m not gonna wear something so precious\n",
      "to me while I’m paintin g. This is pointless, I think you\n",

      "myself to a stranger .”\n",
      "He shrugged . “Who is arguing? I only wanted to drop by\n",
      "to let you know that you shouldn’t get comforta ble here.\n",
      "We’ll be seeing each other more. Your lawyer might have\n",

      "was my husband.\n",
      "Oh, jeez.\n",
      "It was not my night, that was for sure. If Jodi had walked\n",
      "in with bouquets of roses  in her hands to congrat ulate me\n",
      "on the coﬀee shop, I didn’t think I’d have been as surprised\n",
      "as I was. I had successfully continued to ignore the memory\n",
      "of the day I’d gotten married to this speciﬁc stranger , and\n",
      "since he hadn’t been in the city for eight or nine days, it’d\n",
      "worked well—up until now. To be fair, it shouldn’t have come as a surprise. We were, in fact, married so I knew I’d\n",
      "eventually have to see him again, but his timing was the\n",
      "absolute worst. If I’d had the option to choose, I’d have\n",
      "much preferr ed a phone call where I could make my case\n",
      "much more easily before we had to face each other .\n",
      "Before I could say anythin g, he focused on Bryan. “Since\n",
      "I don’t think you’re here to congratulate us, I’m asking you\n",
      "to leave my wife alone.”\n",
      "Bryan had to take a step away from the counter when\n",
      "Jack almost got in his face.\n",
      "“So you do know you have a wife then. From what I\n",
      "heard you weren’t even in the country .”\n",
      "“Excuse me, Mr. Coleson,  my apologies. I didn’t know by\n",
      "marrying your cousin I’d have to share my schedule with\n",
      "you as well. I’ll remedy that as soon as possible.”\n",
      "I really wanted to snort, but managed to hold it in.\n",
      "Jack continued. “Since you’re already here I like to take\n",
      "this opportun ity to repeat what I told you before. I noticed\n",
      "that every time you’re around my wife you’re making her\n",
      "uncomfortable and unhappy . I really don’t think I like it,\n",
      "Bryan. I’m not sure how many times you need me to repeat\n",
      "myself . But I’ll say it again: I don’t want to see you around\n",
      "her.”\n",
      "Since I couldn’t see Jack’s expression with his back to\n",
      "me, I watched the muscle  in Bryan’s jaw twitch and then he\n",
      "forced a smile onto his face.\n",
      "“I was just on my way out anyway . I said what I came\n",
      "here to say , right, Rose?”\n",
      "I said nothing.\n",
      "Jack said nothing.\n",
      "Bryan let out an insincere chuckle. “I’ll leave you two\n",

      "“Rose,” Jack said as a greeting. Just Rose.\n",
      "For a brief moment, I didn’t know what to say. I was\n",
      "fairly sure it was the ﬁrst time he had called me by just my\n",
      "name and not Miss Coleson when we were alone. When we\n",

      "we were done there, I was back to being Miss Coleson. I\n",
      "supposed since I wasn’t  technically a Coleson anymore,\n",
      "using my ﬁrst name was the appropriate choice.\n",
      "Also, dammit, what a sight he was for my sore eyes.\n",
      "Despite the late hour, he was wearing a suit: dark grey\n",
      "slacks and jacket, white button-down, and a black tie. It\n",
      "was simple, but it still packed an expensive punch.\n",
      "Considering what I looked like in that moment, it was a\n",
      "pretty hard punch, too .\n",
      "In that ﬁrst glance, he was nowhere near being my type.\n",
      "I wasn’t into the broody  and aloof who didn’t like using\n",
      "their words all that much, as if you weren’t worthy of a\n",
      "conversation in their eyes. Deﬁnitely wasn’t a fan of the\n",
      "fancy , rich types who came from money and grew up\n",
      "assuming they owned everything and everyone in their\n",
      "vicinity; I’d met my fair share of them living with the\n",
      "Colesons, and we just didn’t mesh well. Other than that, I\n",
      "had nothing personal against them. So, yes, Jack\n",
      "Hawthorne wasn’t my type. However , that didn’t mean I\n",
      "couldn’t appreciate how good he looked with stubble, that\n",
      "sharp jawline , his unique and captivating blue eyes, or the\n",
      "fact that he had a body that wore suits extremely well. No,\n",
      "my issue with my new husband wasn’t his looks—i t was his\n",

      "“Jack…you came back.” Given my half-dead state, that\n",
      "was the best answer I could come up with, pointin g out the\n",
      "obvious. Considering I hadn’t seen or talked to him since\n",
      "the day he left me in that car, I felt like I had every right to\n",
      "be surprised.\n",
      "With the look he gave me, like I was so beneath him, a\n",
      "knot of dread formed in my stomach. I had plenty of self-\n",
      "conﬁdence, but guys like him always excelled at making me\n",
      "feel less than. Dealing with Bryan hadn’t made things\n",

      "me.”\n",
      "I quirked an eyebrow and waited for her to explain.\n",
      "“Mrs. Hawthorne,” she whispered after a quick glance\n",
      "at Raymond.  She put her right hand on the leather seat\n",
      "between us, leaning her upper body toward me as if she\n",
      "was sharing a secret. “That’s the ﬁrst time I’ve been called\n",
      "that. It’s gonna take some getting used to. I’m Mrs.\n",
      "Hawthorne now .”\n",
      "“Yes, you are,” I agreed curtly then looked out my\n",
      "window as she leaned away. In the reﬂection on the glass, I\n",
      "saw her lose the small smile that was playing on her lips\n",
      "and straighten up in her seat. I closed my eyes and took a\n",
      "deep breath. This whole fake marriage thing was going to be harder than I’d initially thought, especially since I\n",
      "seemed to be doing a bad job of it already .\n",
      "I only looked at her again when Raymond stopped the\n",
      "car in front of my place on Central Park West. She glanced\n",
      "out the window and I watched her release a long breath.\n",
      "“This is it?” she asked, peering back at me.\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "I got out of the car. Rubbing my temple, I made it to\n",
      "Raymond’s side just as he opened her door and then\n",
      "walked to the back to get her bag. It seemed like the little\n",
      "ﬁght she’d had in her back at the coﬀee shop had deﬂated\n",
      "during our car ride, and she just stared up at the building.\n",
      "After smiling at my driver softly and thanking him when\n",
      "he held out her bag, she walked a few steps away from us.\n",
      "“The usual time tomorrow , Mr. Hawthorne?” Raymond\n",
      "asked quietly , both our eyes on the woman standing just a\n",
      "few feet away from us.\n",
      "Sighing, I pushed my hands into my pockets and shook\n",
      "my head. “I’ll call you in the morning.”\n",
      "Giving me a quick nod, he got back in the car and drove\n",
      "away , leavin g me alone on the sidewalk. Taking the few\n",
      "steps to close the gap that separated me from my newly\n",
      "acquired wife, I stood beside her .\n",
      "“This is it then,” she repeated, but this time it wasn’t\n",
      "posed as a question.\n",
      "“This is it,” I agreed, and we stood side by side like that\n",
      "for a few agonizingly slow seconds.\n",
      "“It’s really close to the coﬀee shop. I was afraid you\n",
      "lived around Bryant Park, closer to your oﬀice.” She gave\n",
      "me a quick look then faced forward again. “I take the\n",
      "subway from my apartme nt so I could’ve still done that, but\n",
      "this is better , of course.”\n",
      "“I did live close to the ﬁrm at one point. I moved  here\n",
      "two years ago . Shall we go up?”\n",
      "She nodded.  I opened the door for her, and we ﬁnally\n",
      "entered the building we’d been staring at. I ignored the doorman’s greeting and walked straight toward the\n",
      "elevators.\n",
      "With each second it took us to reach the top ﬂoor, I\n",
      "could almost feel her drawing away from me more even\n",
      "though we were physical ly only inches apart. So far every\n",
      "interaction I’d had with her was turning out to be a disaster\n",
      "—not that I was expectin g anything diﬀerent. This was the\n",
      "bed I’d made for us, and now the time had come to lie in it.\n",
      "Eventually , the elevator doors opened, and I stepped out\n",
      "ahead of her. After unlocking the apartment door, I pushed\n",
      "it open  and turned back to look at Rose, really look at her.\n",
      "The quick shower she’d taken had helped with the paint\n",
      "splatters on her face—most of them—but not the fatigue.\n",
      "Her pale skin only accentuated her big and dark eyes and\n",
      "her long lashes. Despite looking like she had been done\n",
      "with the day some hours ago, somehow she still looked\n",
      "strong. She was a determined one and I respected that.\n",
      "Quite. She was clutching  the handle of her bag with one\n",
      "hand and gripping her own elbow with the other . She met\n",
      "my eyes and oﬀered me a small and unsure, but pretty\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "Pretty .\n",
      "Christ, Jack .\n",
      "“Please,” I murmured, gesturing to the inside of the\n",
      "apartment with my hand  and taking a step aside so she\n",
      "could enter. Just as she was passing me, I reache d for her\n",
      "bag, and I supposed I managed to surprise her because she\n",
      "let it go without a struggle.\n",
      "“Thank you,” she muttered quietly , looking around the\n",
      "space.\n",
      "I closed the door after her, locked it, and took a deep\n",
      "breath befor e I faced her again. I was starting to feel like,\n",
      "somehow , the quiet had gotten louder behind the locked\n",
      "doors now that we were there and alone.\n",
      "“Would you like to look around or would you prefer to\n",
      "see your room ﬁrst?” I wasn’t sure if she was feeling up to a tour—I was\n",
      "actually conﬁ dent she’d want to pass on anything I would\n",
      "oﬀer that would force her to spend more time with me—but\n",
      "I wanted her to feel comf ortable since we had two years of\n",
      "this, of us in our future.\n",
      "“Thank you, but you don’t have to do that. If you could\n",
      "show me where I’ll be staying, that’ll be enough.”\n",
      "“I wouldn’t oﬀer if I didn’t want to, Rose. For the\n",
      "foreseeable future, this will be your home too. You should\n",
      "feel comfortable.”\n",
      "“I appreciate you saying that, I really do, but still, can I\n",
      "take a rain check on the tour for tonight? I have to be back\n",
      "at the coﬀee shop tomorrow morning and I’m really tired,\n",
      "so…”\n",
      "“Of course.”  Walking through the foyer , I gestured\n",
      "toward the staircase to our right and followed her silently\n",
      "as she took the lead. Her hand held on to the black steel\n",
      "railing as she slowly and very carefully climbed up to the\n",
      "second ﬂoor. As soon as she was up on the landing, she\n",
      "stepped to the side and waited for me.\n",
      "“This way,” I oﬀered, taking her to the left. The\n",
      "penthouse I had bought  only two years earlier had four\n",
      "bedrooms, three of them  being on the second ﬂoor. One of\n",
      "the rooms was set up as a home gym. The second, which\n",
      "was my bedroom, was on the other end of the hallway , and\n",
      "the third would now be Rose’s. Just hours earlier it had\n",
      "been way too much space for only one person, but with\n",
      "Rose in the apartment, it seemed to shrink in size.\n",
      "At the end of the short hall, I opened the door to the\n",
      "spacious room that would  be hers and placed her overnight\n",
      "bag just inside before backing out again. Giving me a quick\n",
      "look, she stepped inside and took everything in. I had asked\n",
      "the interior decorator to keep it simple and functional, so\n",
      "there were only a few pieces of furniture in the room: a\n",
      "king bed, a neutral-colore d headboard, nightstands, a small\n",
      "sitting area with one soft nude velvet chair , and another chocolate brown one next to a simple white and gold ﬂoor\n",
      "lamp.\n",
      "“You have your own en suite through the right door,” I\n",
      "explained when she didn’t say anything. “The left door is\n",
      "the walk-in closet. If there is anything you don’t like, let me\n",
      "know and I’ll take care of it.”\n",
      "After looking around for a few seconds, she ﬁnally faced\n",
      "me and tucked her damp  hair behind one ear. “This is… I\n",
      "think it’s bigger than my entire apartment.” When my\n",
      "expression didn’t change, she cleared her throat and\n",
      "continued. “Everything looks great, Jack. I hope you didn’t\n",
      "go to too much trouble for this.”\n",
      "“I believe every guest room has a bed and a chair . I\n",
      "didn’t do anything special.”\n",
      "“Of course they do, but considering your guest room is\n",
      "so massive…” She traile d oﬀ. I waited for her to keep\n",
      "going, but she just shook her head. “Thank you. That’s\n",
      "what I’m trying to say . This is beautiful, so thank you.”\n",
      "“You’re welcome. Is there anything else I can do for you,\n",
      "or would you like to be alone?”\n",
      "“I think I’ll just try to get some sleep. I…” Pausing, she\n",
      "lifted her wrist to check the time. “I need to get up really\n",
      "early .”\n",
      "“Everything going okay so far? I don’t want to keep you\n",
      "for long, but did you hear anything from your other\n",
      "cousin?”\n",
      "Shaking her head, she moved closer to me, holding on to\n",
      "the door between us as if she didn’t have enough strength\n",
      "to keep herself upright.\n",
      "“A few days ago, she called, but I think she was just\n",
      "curious if I had gone through with it or not.”\n",
      "I frowned, not following. “Gone through with what? The\n",
      "coﬀee shop?”\n",
      "She oﬀered me a tired smile.\n",
      "“No, she doesn’t really care about that. She was trying\n",
      "to learn more about…us, I guess—you and me and the marriage. She isn’t like Bryan, she rarely cares about\n",
      "things that doesn’t conce rn her. And so far, so good with\n",
      "the coﬀee shop. There is a lot of work to be done as I’m\n",
      "sure you saw yourself , but I’m not complaining.”\n",
      "Satisﬁed with her answer , I reached for my tie and\n",
      "loosened it, noticing the way her eyes followed my\n",
      "movements. “Good. And you don’t have to worry about\n",
      "Bryan either , there is nothing he can do at this point and if\n",
      "he does, I’ll take care of it. Good night, Rose. If you need\n",
      "anything, my room is at the end of the hall, across from\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "Straightening, she nodded. “Thank you, and good\n",
      "night…Jack.”\n",
      "It took me a second to move. I wasn’t sure why I was\n",
      "reluctant to leave, it couldn’t possibly be because I wanted\n",
      "to talk to her more, but there I was just standing there like\n",
      "an idiot. I took a deep breath, trying to think of a parting\n",
      "word so I could leave, but all I managed to do was notice\n",
      "her smell and drown in it. Coconut and some other\n",
      "mysterious fruit I couldn’t quite ﬁgure out. It must’ve been\n",
      "her shampoo since I’d noticed it in the car ﬁrst. I gave up\n",
      "on trying to think of something else to say, gave her a quick\n",
      "nod and walked away from her before I did something\n",
      "stupid. Midw ay down the stairs, I heard Rose’s door gently\n",
      "click shut.\n",
      "FOR THE  HUNDREDTH  TIME , I checked the clock on my\n",
      "nightstand, and ﬁnally when I saw it was four AM and I still\n",
      "hadn’t managed to fall asleep, I sat up. Rubbing my face, I\n",
      "sighed and got up. Not wanting to get dressed and go down\n",
      "yet, I stayed in my pajama pants and put on the grey t-shirt\n",
      "that was already hanging  on the back of the chair in the\n",
      "corner of the room then headed toward the black steel doors that opened up to the terrace. I breathed in the cold\n",
      "air as soon as I stepped outside and took in the city .\n",
      "It didn’t take a genius to understand why I couldn’t\n",
      "sleep, yet I’d still tried my best to ignore the fact that I\n",
      "wasn’t alone in my apartment, that everything was just as it\n",
      "should be. The only issue was that my mind was\n",
      "determined not to let me forget about it, to forget about my\n",
      "wife’s presen ce in my home. Ever since I’d left her crying\n",
      "in the car, it had been all I could see when I closed  my eyes\n",
      "at night— she was all I could see, the look in her eyes. So\n",
      "lost and confused. The fact that I’d practically pushed her—\n",
      "us—into this wasn’t helping at all. Hell, I didn’t even know\n",
      "what to feel anymore, other than guilt that is. I was\n",
      "drowning in guilt. And living under the same roof with\n",
      "Rose…it was helping nothing at all.\n",
      "Looking down at Central Park as I leaned on the railing,\n",
      "I tried to clear my mind so I could get back to bed and get\n",
      "at least a few hours of sleep in order to actually face and\n",
      "survive the next day and the upcoming days. But, after\n",
      "standing out there for God knows how long, I decided it\n",
      "was a futile endeavor . Just as I was turning around, I saw\n",
      "Rose turn the corner at the end of the terrace and let out a\n",
      "loud gasp when she spotted me.\n",
      "One hand against her heart, the other on her knee, she\n",
      "bent down. Letting the blanket she was bundled in hang\n",
      "from her shoulders, she started to cough as if she was\n",
      "choking on something. Without comment, I moved toward\n",
      "her, and before I could decide whether I should try to help\n",
      "her or not, she straighte ned up. Her face was completely\n",
      "ﬂushed, her chest falling and rising rapidly .\n",
      "A second later the cause of her reaction became more\n",
      "clear when she opened her ﬁst and showed me a half-eaten\n",
      "Snickers bar. “You almost killed me,” she wheezed out, her\n",
      "words barely making any sense.\n",
      "“Excuse me?” “I was dying,” she mumbled after attempting to clear\n",
      "her throat again. Finall y regaining her compos ure, she\n",
      "released a long breath and pulled the blanket around\n",
      "herself .\n",
      "“I saw that.” Thinking it’d make her feel more\n",
      "comfortable, I turned away from her and faced the city in\n",
      "front of us.\n",
      "After another  deep breath and a cough, she took the last\n",
      "few steps to stand next to me. “It’s getting chilly,” she\n",
      "commented quietly , and I automatically glanced  down at\n",
      "her feet. She was wearing  socks, but she was resting one of\n",
      "her feet on top of the other .\n",
      "“You might want to wear thicker socks,” I commented,\n",
      "and her gaze followed mine down to her feet and she\n",
      "shifted in place. “But, yes, the weather is changing. You\n",
      "couldn’t sleep?”\n",
      "Out of the corner of my eye, I saw her look up at me and\n",
      "shake her head. I kept my eyes on the city .\n",
      "“Nope. You couldn’t either?” she asked, ﬁlling the\n",
      "silence between us.\n",
      "“I tend to wake up early .” That was what I was telling\n",
      "myself , and I certainly didn’t want her to think I was\n",
      "struggling with having her in my space.\n",
      "She hugged the blanket tighter .\n",
      "“I hope your bed was comfortable.”\n",
      "Another quick glance at me. “It was. It’s really\n",
      "comfortable and big. It’s my ﬁrst night here and it’s a\n",
      "strange place , you know . I thought I heard someth ing when\n",
      "I woke up and couldn’t go back to sleep.”\n",
      "“I understan d.” I didn’t prod for more details, but she\n",
      "kept going.\n",
      "“I’ll get used to it. I did manage to pass out for two\n",
      "hours—I was too tired not to—but then I woke up and my\n",
      "stomach decided it was a good time to remind me that I\n",
      "hadn’t eaten anything in twelve hours, so…” Lifting her\n",
      "hand from under the blanket, she showed me the remaining few bites of her candy bar. “Here I am with the Snickers I\n",
      "found in my bag. I’d give you a piece, but…”\n",
      "“I think I’ll live. You should’ve told me you were hungry\n",
      "when we ﬁrst came in. W e do have a kitchen downstairs.”\n",
      "I glanc ed at her then and she looked up at me with a\n",
      "smile. “A kitchen? What a novelty . As tempting  as that\n",
      "sounds, if I eat anything more than this, I’ll stay up all night\n",
      "and I won’t be able to do anything tomorrow . I need to start\n",
      "getting ready in a few hours anyway , so this will hold me\n",
      "over. Plus, nothing beats chocolate.”\n",
      "“You should go back to bed then.”\n",
      "“I will,” she murmured, agreeing easily . “I’ll go back\n",
      "inside in a few minutes.”\n",
      "I nodd ed, but I knew she couldn’t see me; she was\n",
      "watching the night sky. We fell into another long stretch of\n",
      "silence and, not sure what I should do, I crossed  my arms\n",
      "against my chest and leaned back against the wall at the\n",
      "same time she moved forward and propped her forearms\n",
      "on the railing.\n",
      "“The lake looks beautiful from up here,” she whispered.\n",
      "Glancing at me over her shoulder , she waited for an\n",
      "answer . “You must love the view.” I nodded in agreement,\n",
      "and a small sigh fell from her lips as she faced  forward\n",
      "again. “The leaves will start changing color in a few weeks.\n",
      "I love Central Park in fall, and the lake is one of my favorite\n",
      "spots. It’s so cool that you can see it from here. Do you\n",
      "have a favorite spot, Jack?”\n",
      "“In Central P ark?”\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "As the loud sound of sirens ﬁlled the night, I took a few\n",
      "seconds to answer so I wouldn’t have to raise my voice. All\n",
      "bundled up in her blanke t, she faced me, ready to hear my\n",
      "answer . She was deﬁnitely an insistent one, my wife.\n",
      "“I never thought about it. I guess the lake is all right.”\n",
      "She arched an eyebrow and just stared at me. I returned her stare. “Is there anything I can help you\n",
      "with at the coﬀee shop?”\n",
      "She cocked her head and studied me as if she could\n",
      "ﬁgure me out if she only looked hard enough. I had no idea\n",
      "what she was thinking. Not only that, I had no idea what I\n",
      "was doing out there, pulling her into more conversation\n",
      "when I’d decided the moment after we’d said I do that I\n",
      "didn’t want to get too close to her. The only thing  I had to\n",
      "do was keep reminding myself that this was going to be a\n",
      "business deal and nothing more.\n",
      "“You already  helped. If it wasn’t for you, it would’ve\n",
      "never happened. When I got Gary’s permission to use the\n",
      "space and we signed that contract, I started ordering the\n",
      "furniture, the machines, and all the other bits and pieces\n",
      "I’ll need. I knew it woul d take time for everything to get\n",
      "here, so I thought I was being smart. When…Gary and\n",
      "Angela passed away , I completely forgot about the whole\n",
      "thing. Then things starte d to arrive, but I no longer had a\n",
      "coﬀee shop to put them in, so I had to rent a storage place\n",
      "for the items from the companies that couldn’t hold my\n",
      "orders for the foreseeable future, like the chairs. Some\n",
      "things I bought were from sales and other deals, so they\n",
      "wouldn’t cancel my orders, either . When I came  to your\n",
      "oﬀice that day, I had no hope of things going my way. I was\n",
      "on my way to another job interview .”\n",
      "Uncomfortable with her admission, I shifted in place and\n",
      "cleared my throat. Before  I could stop her, she kept going.\n",
      "Not only was she insisten t, she was turning out to be quite\n",
      "the talker .\n",
      "“So, as weird and awkward as this marriage is and\n",
      "probably will be for quite some time as we get used to\n",
      "having each other around , I’m really thankful for it. I know\n",
      "we made a deal and obviously it’s not gonna be a one-sided\n",
      "thing, but I’m still very thankful that you decided not to get\n",
      "a divorce.” “You don’t have to keep  thanking me. It’s a business\n",

      "I already knew the details surrounding her situation, but\n",

      "“I rather not share.”\n",
      "“Oh. Okay .”\n",
      "When I didn’t comment further , she took a deep breath\n",
      "and looked toward the corner where she had appeared\n",
      "from. After giving Central Park another quick look, she\n",
      "sighed. “You probably want to be alone, so I’ll just go back\n",

      "anyway . Good night, Jack.”\n",
      "I watch ed her in silence up until she turned her back to\n",

      "from the wall and took her spot at the rail. Turns out I\n",
      "didn’t like putting that hurt look on her face. Raising my\n",

      "alone fall asleep. What if you hadn’t locked the door, which\n",
      "you forgot to do before? It could’ve been anyone walking\n",
      "through that door and ﬁnding you sleeping.”\n",
      "“But I didn’t  forget to lock the door. It was just that one\n",
      "time. I’ve been making sure it’s locked no matter what time\n",
      "it is,” I count ered. I wouldn’t admit that for a brief moment\n",
      "when I’d heard his hard knock, I’d been just a bit scared.\n",
      "My reply earned me another disapproving look. “I see\n",
      "you ﬁnally got your chair s,” he commented, his gaze taking\n",
      "everything in.\n",
      "“Yes. The delivery was delayed, but I ﬁnally got them a\n",
      "few hours ago. What do you think?” I asked. Even I could\n",
      "hear the hopeful tone in my voice. He was the ﬁrst one to\n",
      "see the place  ﬁlled with the furniture and so close to what it would look like on opening day. I was desperat e to hear\n",
      "from someone that it wasn’t just my imaginatio n and it\n",
      "actually did look good.\n",
      "Our eyes met as I held my breath, waiting.\n",
      "“About?” he asked.\n",
      "I tamped down the urge to groan.\n",
      "He couldn’t ﬁnd any fault in them—there was no way.\n",
      "They looked perfect with the color scheme. Elegant, chic,\n",
      "comfy , invitin g—all the good stuﬀ. So, I smiled instead and\n",
      "tried again. “Everything. The chairs, tables, everything.”\n",
      "He followed my gaze, but his hard features stayed\n",
      "exactly the same, not a single smile in sight.\n",
      "“Is it done?”\n",
      "“Not yet,” I said slowly , my smile dimming. “I’m working\n",
      "on it, but it’s pretty close now .”\n",
      "All eleven—I  hated that it was an odd number— of my\n",
      "wooden round tables were exactly where I wanted them,\n",
      "and I’d placed the brownish nude cotton-velvet chairs that\n",
      "looked gorgeous with the ﬂooring and the freshly painted\n",
      "walls in their places. I’d also taken out the black steel bar\n",
      "stools and the dark green cushions from the kitchen where\n",
      "I’d kept them stacked. They were the same material as the\n",
      "chairs, and I had put them all in front of the coﬀee bar I\n",
      "had running along the front windows. It already looked\n",
      "amazing, but apparently only to my eyes.\n",
      "“Never mind,” I said, breaking the silence in an eﬀort to\n",
      "avoid hearing Jack’s negative thoughts. His rigid body\n",
      "language and disapproving gaze were telling me everything\n",
      "I didn’t want to hear anyway. “I’m sorry , you don’t have to\n",
      "deal with this. If you need  to be somewhere else, I wouldn’t\n",
      "want to keep you. I’m gonna be here for another hour I\n",
      "think, to put some stuﬀ up.”\n",
      "He opened his mouth to speak, but I got there before he\n",
      "could.\n",
      "“I know—I’ll  go to your place when I’m done here. You\n",
      "don’t have to keep comin g back here every day. I know the way.”\n",
      "His hands in his pockets, he walked toward the big\n",
      "archway that connected the two sections of the coﬀee shop\n",
      "and turned toward the back, out of my sight. I’d have bet\n",
      "money he was shaking his head after noticing my bookcase\n",
      "sprawled on the ﬂoor, or if not that, he was probably\n",
      "scalding the bookcase with a disapproving look. I’d\n",
      "assembled it just ﬁne on my own, but I hadn’t dared to\n",
      "actually lift it and move it. That would be the next day’s job,\n",
      "or the next. It all depended on how my back was feeling.\n",
      "“How are you planning to get in exactly?” he asked, his\n",
      "voice just barely rising so I could hear him.\n",
      "“Get in where?”\n",
      "“Into my apartment— our apartment.”\n",
      "Our apartment. Dear God. Exactly when would I get\n",
      "used to the fact that I was living with this man now, and\n",
      "how, for two entire weeks, had it not even crossed  my mind\n",
      "how I’d get back into his little mansion? Then again, since\n",
      "he came to the coﬀee shop every night to pick me up, I had\n",
      "no reason to think of keys.\n",
      "To be fair, he had never acted as if I wasn’t welcome in\n",
      "his home. Sure, he was curt and exasperating sometimes,\n",
      "but still, every night, he oﬀered to give the tour he had\n",
      "mentioned that ﬁrst night and asked if I’d had anything to\n",
      "eat. You’d think that was sweet of him, but that was all he\n",
      "would say . Still sweet though.\n",
      "“I tried to leave a set of keys with you this morning, but\n",
      "when I knocked on your door, you were already gone and I\n",
      "had to leave for work,” he explained. Surprised, I couldn’t\n",
      "think of anything to say. Then he reappeared in the\n",
      "archway and came back to stand in front of me, patiently\n",
      "waiting for an explanation.\n",
      "It hit me, and I winced. “Ah, is that why you come here\n",
      "to pick me up every night?” I blew out a breath and sighed.\n",
      "“I was just thinking I shou ldn’t keep apologizing to you, but\n",
      "for the last time, I’m sorry . I hope you haven’t been cutting your plans short and coming here just because I don’t have\n",
      "a key .”\n",
      "“No need to apologize. I only thought about the key last\n",
      "night, and no, I’m not coming here every night just because\n",
      "you don’t have a key. Today, I was already on the east side,\n",
      "and when I couldn’t get in touch with you, I thought I’d\n",
      "come here and give you a ride back.”\n",
      "What about all the other nights?  I wanted to ask but\n",
      "kept my mouth shut.\n",
      "“I’m still having trouble sleeping. I’m not exactly sure\n",
      "why, but I always wake up at four or ﬁve. I wait until six\n",
      "and then leave. Instead of tossing and turning in bed, I try\n",
      "to do something useful around here.” I met his gaze, out of\n",
      "words, out of explanations.\n",
      "“I know what time you leave, Rose.”\n",
      "As soon as he ﬁnished his sentence, he started to take\n",
      "oﬀ his suit jacket, and my attention shifted again.\n",
      "“Uh, what are you doing?”\n",
      "“I’m assuming the bookc ase won’t be living on the ﬂoor\n",
      "and you want it up, correct?” He looked around and then\n",
      "pointed to the exact spot I’d planned to put it, right next to\n",
      "where my humongous espresso machine was going to\n",
      "happily take up residence in just a few days. “There?”\n",
      "“Yes, that’s wha…”\n",
      "He unbuttoned his cuﬀs and my gaze dropped to follow\n",
      "his movements. This again? Then he started to roll his\n",
      "sleeves up, and I couldn’t remember what I had been about\n",
      "to say— which was becoming annoying, if nothing else—but\n",
      "also his ﬁngers looked really long. Apart from having\n",
      "strong features, insanely beautiful eyes, a very enjoyable-\n",
      "to-look -at face, and a jawline that worked extremely  well\n",
      "with that broody persona lity he had going on, he also had\n",
      "very manly hands. That must’ve been nice for him. They\n",
      "were easily twice the size of mine. They looked strong. The\n",
      "kind that made you look twice, if you were into that sort of\n",
      "thing. Apparently I was. V ery. Jeez, Rose.\n",
      "I ment ally shook myself out of it, looked away , cleared\n",
      "my throat, and spoke up. “I was planning on doing that\n",
      "tomorrow . You don’t have to get your clothes dirty, Jack. I\n",
      "can handle it myself .”\n",
      "I wasn’t one of those people who would reject help at all\n",
      "times, but getting help from Jack…I didn’t want to be\n",
      "indebted to him more than I already was.\n",
      "Ignoring me, he moved toward the bookcase while still\n",
      "working on those sleeves, for Christ’s sake. I followed him\n",
      "in quick steps, my eyes— the traitors—stealing glances at\n",
      "his hands rolling those sleeves up. He was still wearing his\n",
      "ring, he never took it oﬀ .\n",
      "“Jack, I can take care of it. Y ou really don’t have to—”\n",
      "“You don’t have to handl e it all on your own. I’m here.\n",
      "I’m capable of moving a bookcase.”\n",
      "“I know that. Of course you are, but I’m saying you don’t\n",
      "have to do it. I’m used to handling things on my own, and\n",
      "that’s what I’m comfortable wi—”\n",
      "The sleeves had been rolled meticulously , so he lifted his\n",
      "head to give me a long look. I shut up.\n",
      "Fine.\n",
      "If he wanted to get his expensive suit dirty, he was\n",
      "welcome to do so. After scolding me with a simple stare, he\n",
      "started to walk around the bookcase.\n",
      "“It might scratch the ﬂooring,” he said as he glanc ed up\n",
      "at me and then back down.\n",
      "“No, it won’t. I put four of those soft thingies under the\n",
      "legs, so it won’t scratch.”\n",
      "That got him to look at me. “Thingies,” he deadpanned.\n",
      "I couldn’t help it—my lips slowly curved up and I smiled,\n",
      "with my teeth showing and all. “Sure, it sounds ridiculous\n",
      "when you say it.” If one of us didn’t relax around the other ,\n",
      "I was surely going to commit murder before the twenty-\n",
      "four months ended. Since  I didn’t think Jack ever relaxed or had ever relaxed before, it looked like I was going to be the\n",
      "lucky winner in this marriage.\n",
      "I was going to try my best to loosen up around him and\n",
      "ignore the fact that he was the type of guy I always stayed\n",
      "away from.\n",
      "Because we were complete opposites.\n",
      "Because we had very diﬀerent outlooks on life.\n",
      "Because, because, because…\n",
      "He was standoﬀish, prickly , arrogant at times, aloof .\n",
      "He gave me a quick unimpressed look and turned his\n",
      "back to me. “That’s because it is a ridiculous word.”\n",
      "When he wasn’t looking at me anymore, I took a deep\n",
      "breath and glanced up to the heavens, though I couldn’t\n",
      "actually see them. “Your suit is gonna get dirty,” I said for\n",
      "the last time. When those hard eyes met mine, I lifted my\n",
      "hands up. “Fine. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. Oh, wait!”\n",
      "Before he could give me a sarcastic answer , I rushed out of\n",
      "the alcove, all the while yelling over my shoulder , “Give me\n",
      "a second and I’ll wipe it down ﬁrst.”\n",
      "He didn’t say anything so I assumed he was waiting for\n",
      "me to come  back. As soon as I had a wet dish towel, I\n",
      "hurried back only to see he already had the bookcase up\n",
      "and standing.\n",
      "“It’s not a big thing, but I want you to meet some of the\n",
      "partners in my ﬁrm,” he started as I stepped aside with the\n",
      "towel in my hand and he started to push the bookcase\n",
      "toward its new home. “There is a dinner tomorrow with two\n",
      "of the partners and a potential client, nothing formal, just a\n",
      "simple meal.  They know we got married and asked me to\n",
      "bring you with me. I know you’re working day and night to\n",
      "open this place so if you can’t spare the time, you don’t\n",
      "have to join us for this one. I’ll explain it to them.”\n",
      "I put the towel down on one of the tables and pulled the\n",
      "two chairs and another table that were in his way to the\n",
      "side. “No, I’ll come.” He stopped pushing and tilted his head to look at me\n",
      "from the other side of the bookcase. “Are you sure? Like I\n",
      "said, you don’t have to .”\n",
      "“We made a business deal, right? And you keep helping\n",
      "me when you come here. I have to do something in return,”\n",
      "I answered as I gripped the other end of the book case and\n",
      "started helping him turn it around so we could push it the\n",
      "rest of the way with the back facing toward the wall. A\n",
      "dinner wasn’ t such a bad thing as long as we didn’t freeze\n",
      "up and he didn’t go all cold on me in front of other  people—\n",
      "which wasn’t my problem.\n",
      "“Right,” he said in a clipped tone, and we both started\n",
      "pushing.\n",
      "The only problem about going out to dinner with Jack\n",
      "and his partners was that I could only imagine what kind of\n",
      "restaurant partners at a high-proﬁle law ﬁrm would go to,\n",
      "and unfortunately , I didn’t have anything nice enough to\n",
      "wear to a place like that. Every cent I had earned up till\n",
      "that day, I’d put aside for the dream coﬀee shop  I would\n",
      "open in New York. Now that dream was actually coming\n",
      "true, and when you were working as hard as humanly\n",
      "possible to do that, other things usually suﬀered, like my\n",
      "fashion choices.\n",
      "“So, I’ll come. Okay , stop. Just give me a sec and I’ll\n",
      "move the tables so we can push through.”\n",
      "While I moved the table on the right, he took care of the\n",
      "one on the left. Then we pushed the chairs aside, opening\n",
      "up enough space for the big bookcase to go through.\n",
      "“You want it to touch the wall? The dinner is at seven.”\n",
      "“Yes, ﬂush against the wall. I’ll be ready before that.\n",
      "Sally will drop by for a few hours tomorrow to help so it\n",
      "shouldn’t be a very long day like today was.”\n",
      "With a small  grunt from me, we started pushing again\n",
      "until it was in place. After putting the tables and chairs\n",
      "back where they’d originally been, we stopped. I stepped all the way back to the archway so I could\n",
      "make sure it was center ed on the wall. Jack followed and\n",
      "silently stood beside me.\n",
      "“Thank you. That looks perfect right there.” I glanced at\n",
      "him and caught his small nod.\n",
      "“Sally?” he asked, his eyes still assessing the bookcase.\n",
      "“My employee, the second and last one. I hired her while\n",
      "you were in London. She’s been here a few times to talk\n",
      "about what we’re going to do here, and she oﬀicia lly starts\n",
      "on opening day .”\n",
      "“Who is the ﬁrst?”\n",
      "“Oh, that would be Owen . We brieﬂy worked together at\n",
      "a café before, that’s where I know him from. His pastries\n",
      "are amazing. He’ll be here part-time, come in around four-\n",
      "thirty in the morning and start on the baking before I join\n",
      "him. Sally will help me in the front.”\n",
      "“What else needs to get done today?” he asked.\n",
      "Even though the bookcase was perfectly placed, the two\n",
      "tables in front of it just didn’t look right where they were, I\n",
      "retraced my steps to move them so they’d be on the sides\n",
      "of the bookcase instead of in front of it.\n",
      "When I looked up, Jack was already standing across\n",
      "from me, grabbing the edge of the table and helpin g me lift\n",
      "it. “What do you mean what else?” I asked as we put the\n",
      "table down where I wanted and then moved the chairs.\n",
      "“What else needs to be done?”\n",
      "We went to the other table and repeated our actions.\n",
      "“You don—”\n",
      "“If you say I don’t have to help one more time—”\n",
      "“As a matter  of fact, I was not going to say that.” I\n",
      "actually was. “You should listen ﬁrst before accusing\n",
      "someone. You’d think, as a lawyer , you’d know that.” When\n",
      "he looked at me, I gave him a sweet smile without teeth. He\n",
      "didn’t return it, of course. He wasn’t a fan of sarcastic\n",
      "comments; I had discovered that much on my own, which\n",
      "was probably why I enjoyed making them in the ﬁrst place. “I want to get this up.” I walked behind the counter and\n",
      "stood directl y in front of where I wanted the ﬂoating shelf\n",
      "to be. “I drilled the holes, and the brackets are secured and\n",
      "everything, but it’s a pretty damn big wooden shelf , almost\n",
      "two feet I think, so I couldn’t lift it on my own.”\n",
      "He joined me, and I move d to the side to give him space.\n",
      "It was a big enough area for four people to work\n",
      "comfortably , but still. After looking at his hands that much,\n",
      "I couldn’t trust myself .\n",
      "“You drilled these?” he asked, inspecting the brackets.\n",
      "My feet were starting to kill me again, so I leaned\n",
      "against the counter and waited for his disapproving\n",
      "comments to start. I had some comebacks still. “Yeah. I\n",
      "borrowed a drill from the chair guy and got them done\n",
      "quickly . Go ahead, tell me how bad of a job I did. I’m ready\n",
      "for it.”\n",
      "He sighed and glanced at me over his shoulder . “Where\n",
      "is the shelf , Rose?”\n",
      "I straightened and squatted. There was a lot of pain\n",
      "involved in that process.  “Here.” I pulled just one side of\n",
      "the wood from under the counter so he could see it. He\n",
      "held on to the other side and we lifted it up with a small\n",
      "grunt from me then placed it on the counter . The damn\n",
      "thing was extremely heav y, not to mention expensive, but it\n",
      "was going to look perfect with the dark green walls.\n",
      "There were a few seconds of inspection on his side then\n",
      "he grabbed his end again. “Ready?”\n",
      "I relea sed a long breath, nodded, and gripped the edge\n",
      "tighter .\n",
      "He paused and gave me a new look I couldn’t interpret.\n",
      "“On three. Y ou ready?”\n",
      "My exhaustion was comin g back in full force so I simply\n",
      "nodded again, heaving it up when he said three. I was\n",
      "pretty sure he was takin g most of the weight because my\n",
      "arms didn’t hurt as much as I expected them to, and in a few seconds,  he’d slid the shelf onto the brackets and we\n",
      "were done.\n",
      "Facing me, he studied my face. “Can we leave now?”\n",
      "Again, I just nodded.\n",
      "He strolled out into the open area in front of the counter .\n",
      "I went into the kitchen and grabbed my things from the\n",
      "big island. Coming out of the kitchen with one arm in my\n",
      "jacket, I struggled to get the other one in.\n",
      "Jack was rolling down his sleeves. “You don’t have\n",
      "anything else heavy that needs to be moved, do you?”\n",
      "Frowning and trying to think as I watched him, I shook\n",
      "my head. “No . That was the last one, I believe.”\n",
      "Then he put his suit jacket back on, and he looked just\n",
      "as he had when he’d showed up earlier , minus the tie.\n",
      "“You look like you’re about to crash.”\n",
      "He wasn’t even looking at me—how did he know?\n",
      "“I think I can make that happen.” Feeling a little silly\n",
      "after his comment and about the fact that I was still\n",
      "struggling with the other jacket arm, I cleared my throat.\n",
      "“The crashin g, I mean.” He came forward and, with a long-\n",
      "suﬀering sigh, pulled the jacket oﬀ, freeing my arm. Then\n",
      "he held it up for me and I felt myself blush as I successfully\n",
      "got both arms in.\n",
      "“Thank you,” I muttered quietly .\n",
      "“I’ll call Raymond so he can park out front.” He was\n",
      "looking down  at his phone , but then his eyes met mine for a\n",
      "brief second. “ You look worse than you did last week.”\n",
      "I opened my mouth then decided to close it. I looked\n",
      "down and noticed that my knees were covered in dust. Nice\n",
      "touch, Rose. Really nice touch.  I gently dusted myself oﬀ,\n",
      "all the while thinking who knew what other substances I\n",
      "had on my face or what said face actually looked like. Jack\n",
      "apparently did know , and it so happened to look worse than\n",
      "it had the week before. No biggie. Every husba nd made\n",
      "comments like that to their wives…I thought. Essentially ,\n",
      "we were settling into married life. I thought he was broody male perfection, and he thought I was…well, to be honest, I\n",
      "was too scared to ask and hear his answer .\n",
      "I sighed and looked up so I could meet his gaze. “I can’t\n",
      "believe I’m saying this, but I think I’m actually starting to\n",
      "consider keeping you around as my husband, perm anently ,\n",
      "Jack. I’m really liking these compliments so far, but I’m\n",
      "warning you, you can’t blame me when all these pretty\n",
      "words start to go to my head.”\n",
      "I thought I imagined his lips pressing together in an\n",
      "eﬀort to hold back a smile, though maybe it was a lip\n",
      "twitch. I would never know , but I squinted to make sure I\n",
      "was seeing right. Then again, my eyesight was still kind of\n",
      "blurry , so I was almost certain it had been just a trick of my\n",
      "eye.\n",
      "When he commented in his businesslike tone, I knew for\n",
      "sure there were no smile s involved. “Would you like me to\n",

      "like me to pick you up?”\n",
      "“Oh, yes please. Around six, maybe?” My eye caught on\n",
      "a book that was still in one of the cardboard boxes, so I\n",
      "grabbed it and checked the back cover .\n",
      "“That won’t work. With the traﬀic, it will take us at least\n",

      "“No, you can just pick me up on your way to the\n",

      "another one up from the ﬂoor . “Jack?”\n",
      "“Why didn’t you tell me you didn’t have a—never mind.\n",
      "I’ll be there at six.”\n",

      "ready . Since my wardrobe didn’t include a dress fancy\n",
      "enough to go with one of Jack’s expensive suits, I had gone\n",
      "out and looked for something I could wear that wouldn’t\n",
      "look too cheap while I was standing next to him. I didn’t\n",
      "want a painful repeat of the day we got married.\n",
      "Thankfully , I’d found something in the second store I\n",
      "rushed into when I headed out on my lunch break.\n",
      "It was as simple as a black dress could get. It was made\n",
      "of a thin material, the name of which I had no idea\n",
      "whatsoever , and had short sleeves. It hugged my hourglass\n",
      "body lightly from what I could see after craning my neck to\n",
      "the left and right in the dressing room, and it ended about\n",
      "six or seven inches abov e my knee. The front V was a bit\n",
      "deeper than I was accustomed to, but it wasn’t bad enough\n",
      "to look for something else. More importantly , since it\n",
      "wasn’t exactly a winter dress, it was on sale. I didn’t have\n",
      "the time to search every store in the city for just the right\n",
      "thing. I tried it, it ﬁt, so I bought it. It was also a bit pricier\n",
      "than I would normally pay for a dress, not a luxury brand or anything like that, but again, I was going for a look that\n",
      "wouldn’t make me feel extremely  cheap next to Jack. So, I\n",
      "accepted that this speciﬁc look came with a price tag.\n",
      "I was able to get ready in twenty minutes and had even\n",
      "managed to turn my light makeup into something more\n",
      "suitable for evening. In other words, a whole lot of\n",
      "concealer was covering the dark circles under my eyes, and\n",
      "my cheeks were touched with a little blush—qu ite a bit,\n",
      "actually . Checking the time, I rushed through my eyes by\n",
      "applying a little black pencil along my lash line and\n",
      "smudging it with my ﬁnger until it resembled something\n",
      "smoky and acceptable instead of a complete mess. Just as I\n",

      "message.\n",
      "Jack:  Open the door .\n",
      "I snorted; my husband had such a way with words. I\n",

      "to tame my boobs, which looked bigger because of the deep\n",
      "V, I inspected my makeup closer . I didn’t look like a\n",

      "I had braided it two hours earlier so I could have something\n",
      "that resembled a wavy look, so I tore oﬀ the hair tie at the\n",

      "I ran back to the counter , and after conﬁrming it was\n",
      "Jack, I ran to the door, my hands in my hair, trying to tame\n",

      "special look.\n",
      "Stopping next to the door, I ran my hands through my\n",
      "bangs for the last time, unlocked the door, threw it wide\n",
      "open and ran away before he could get a good look at me. “We’ve been waiting for you outside. You’re late,” Jack\n",
      "said as soon as he stepped inside.\n",
      "“You’re ﬁve minutes early ,” I countered over my\n",
      "shoulder without looking back as I kept running straight\n",
      "back to the kitchen to put my jacket on. After tying the thin\n",

      "Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.\n",
      "My favorite curse word was the only thing that came to\n",
      "my mind, and I didn’t think it would be appropriate to say\n",
      "out loud in this situation.\n",
      "Jack was wearing black slacks, which wasn’t anything\n",
      "surprising, but it was deﬁnitely the ﬁrst time I was seeing\n",
      "him without a button-up shirt on. Instead, he was wearing a\n",
      "thin grey sweater with the arms slightly pushed up, giving\n",
      "me a view of the watch on his wrist.\n",
      "A simp le grey sweater and a watch had rendered me\n",
      "completely speechless. Like the jackass I was, I let my eyes\n",
      "wander from his ﬁtted sweater to his belt and down to his\n",
      "black shoes. His face was just as it always was: same sharp\n",
      "jawline, same deep blue eyes, same rough stubble, a no-\n",
      "nonsense look in his eyes and the usual frown between his\n",
      "eyebrows. His hair looked like it had been roughly raked\n",
      "back with his hands with some sort of matte product.\n",
      "Overall, he looked…okay . Fine, maybe a bit more than\n",
      "okay.\n",
      "Staring into his eyes, wanting to play it safe, I waited for\n",
      "him to say something. I didn’t want to give it away too\n",
      "much that I might actually be attracted to him.\n",
      "“Something wrong?” he asked.\n",
      "I shook my head. He studied me some more. “Ready then?”\n",
      "I nodded, not saying a word.\n",
      "“What’s wrong with you?”\n",
      "I released a long sigh. “Nothing is wrong with me.\n",
      "What’s wrong with you?”\n",
      "His stare intensiﬁed, so before I could get myself in\n",
      "trouble, I reached past him and opened the door, lightly\n",
      "bowing like an idiot who didn’t know what to do with\n",
      "herself and gesturing for him to leave. He stood there for\n",
      "another mom ent then, shaking his head at me, walked out.\n",
      "Taking care of the lights and pushing in the code to the\n",
      "alarm, I locked everythin g up and closed the door. Resting\n",
      "my forehead  against it, I quietly murmured to myself and\n",
      "faced Jack, who was waiting for me with his hands in the\n",
      "pockets of his pants just a few steps ahead. I looked down\n",
      "the street a short ways and saw his car waiting for us.\n",
      "As soon as I was next to Jack, he walked ahea d and\n",
      "opened the door for me. I got in and scooted to the other\n",
      "end. “Hi, R aymond. I’m sorry for making you wait.”\n",
      "Jack got in after me and closed the door. I was fairly\n",
      "sure Raymond was the only person who knew about our\n",
      "fake marriage. He had been our only witness at city hall,\n",
      "and even if he hadn’t been there, there was no reality\n",
      "where he would believe we were a newly married couple\n",

      "two weeks.\n",
      "Since I was looking at the rearview mirror , I saw his\n",

      "too long.”\n",
      "I smiled back.\n",
      "See, I thought as I gave Jack side eye. Why can’t you be\n",
      "like R aymond and smile at me just once or twice?\n",
      "He started talking to Raymond and then we were on the\n",
      "way to our destination. I closed my eyes and breathed in,\n",
      "only to be assaulted by Jack’s cologne.\n",
      "Dear God. Dear God!  That was all I could think of as I slowly let it\n",
      "all out and tried not to breathe much. His other cologne,\n",
      "the one I’d smelled on him every day for the last two\n",
      "weeks, was not as deep and musky as this one. This one\n",
      "would pretty much knoc k anyone oﬀ their ass and make\n",
      "them start salivating, fake wife or not. I pushed the button\n",
      "on the armrest to roll the window down a bit and let a little\n",
      "fresh air snap me out of my idiocy .\n",
      "“How far away is it, Raymond?” I asked when I found my\n",
      "voice again. “The restaurant, I mean.”\n",
      "“Half an hour , maybe a little more, Mrs. Hawthorne.”\n",
      "I groaned on the inside and looked at Jack. “Did you\n",
      "change your cologne?”\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "“I’m not sure if I like it.” I loved it. I loved it too much.\n",
      "He rolled his watch around his wrist and looked away\n",
      "from me. “T oo bad for you.”\n",
      "How had I known he would say something along those\n",
      "lines? I faced the window and smiled. He was starting to\n",
      "grow on me. If I had learned one thing about Jack\n",
      "Hawthorne, it was how unwilling he was to make small\n",
      "talk, and since I wasn’t eager to spend almost an hour in\n",
      "silence, I decided I’d have to be the one to start talking.\n",
      "Yet, when I glanced at Jack and saw him sitting so relaxed\n",
      "and looking out his wind ow, I couldn’t come up with any\n",
      "interesting topics. I thought I was really good at pushing\n",
      "his buttons, but for some reason, I decided the cologne\n",
      "comment was enough for our car ride.\n",
      "Giving up on every idea of small talk that came  after\n",
      "that, I rested my templ e on the cold glass window and\n",
      "closed my eyes. I didn’t know how many minutes passed in\n",
      "silence, but when I heard  Jack’s soft voice, I forced  my eyes\n",
      "to open with some diﬀiculty , not having even realized I’d\n",
      "fallen asleep.\n",
      "“Rose?” I glanced to my right only to ﬁnd him watching me\n",
      "carefully . The car wasn’t moving, so apparently I’d dozed\n",
      "oﬀ for longer than I’d thought. “Are we there?” I covered\n",
      "my mouth with the back of my hand and yawned.\n",
      "His frown smoothed out and he shook his head. “We’re\n",
      "at a stoplight, almost there. Y ou’re tired.”\n",
      "At least that was better than You look awful.  You’re tired\n",
      "was just a fact and I could live with that. “The makeup\n",
      "didn’t hide it enough, then,” I muttered. I was a whole lot\n",
      "of things, not just tired. I dropped my head back and took a\n",
      "deep breath. “Sorry for dozing oﬀ .”\n",
      "The light turned green.\n",
      "“I take it you didn’t get any sleep last night either?”\n",
      "“I did, actually—ﬁve hours this time. I’m hoping tonight\n",
      "is the night I’ll sleep my usual amount.”\n",
      "Two police cars with their sirens blaring passed us and\n",
      "my eyes followed them.\n",
      "“Are you sure you’re up for this dinner?” Jack asked\n",
      "when it was quieter—as quiet as New Y ork got.\n",
      "Sitting up straighter , I turned to him. “Of course. I won’t\n",

      "worse, I was sure of that much. If all else failed, I’d just be\n",

      "good ﬁt.\n",
      "The frown came back in full force. “That’s not what I\n",
      "asked.”\n",
      "“No, I know , but I’m up for it. I got ready , and I’m here. I\n",
      "just wanted you to know…that I wouldn’t disappoint you.”\n",
      "After we shared an awkw ardly long look as the passing\n",

      "Too soon, Raymond stopp ed the car and I looked out the\n",

      "we would meet with Jack’s partners.\n",
      "“Try to look half alive at least,” Jack said.\n",
      "It was going to be a complete disaster . They were never\n",
      "going to believe we were in love. There was no way . “Such pretty words. If you want half alive, that’s what\n",
      "you’ll get. If you had asked me to look fully alive, I would’ve\n",
      "deﬁnitely disappointed you. Half alive, though? You’re in\n",

      "The butterﬂies in my stomach instantly started a riot. I\n",
      "didn’t even notice Jack had gotten out of the car until he\n",
      "opened my door. Snapping out of my private panic, I\n",
      "scooted forward to exit. Noticing the bulky handbag\n",
      "clutched in my ﬁngers, I paused and met Raymond’s gaze.\n",
      "“Would it be okay if I left my bag in the car?”\n",
      "“Of course, Mrs. Hawthorne.”\n",
      "I met his eyes in the rearview mirror again and gave him\n",
      "a pleading look. “I’d really feel so much better if you would\n",

      "He gave me a small nod and a barely there smile. “I’ll do\n",
      "my best.”\n",
      "I forced my lips to curve up and got out of the car\n",
      "without my purse. Brushing my hands on the fabric of my\n",
      "jacket, I waited for Jack to close the door. Then Raymond\n",
      "pulled away and it was just the two of us, standing on the\n",
      "edge of the sidewalk right in front of the double  doors of\n",
      "the very brightly lit and full restaurant.\n",
      "“No handbag ?” he asked, noticing my empty , nervous\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "I stopped the ﬁdgeting and shook my head, my eyes still\n",
      "on those big double doors—the gateway to my hell. “I didn’t\n",
      "have one that was elegan t enough. This is better .” I caught\n",
      "Jack’s tight expression right before he took a step forward.\n",
      "Before I knew it, my hand was clutching his arm. I gave\n",
      "him a desperate look. “ Jack, we forgot!”\n",
      "His eyebrows drew together . “We forgot what?\n",

      "“My cologne did what?”\n",
      "“Forget about the cologne!”\n",
      "He sighed. “ What story are you talking about?” For someone who was about to lie to a bunch of his work\n",
      "friends, he looked oddly relaxed, which only made me more\n",
      "nervous and slightly angry. “A story about how we met!\n",
      "How you asked me to marry you!” I burst out and then\n",
      "lowered my voice. “They  will ask something, if not those\n",
      "questions, something about us—you know they will.\n",
      "Everyone asks those questions.”\n",
      "He shrugged, and this time it was me who looked\n",
      "confused. “We’ll come up with something if they do. Just\n",
      "act natural,” he said. “ Are you nervous about this?”\n",
      "Just act natural?\n",
      "I gave him an exasperate d look. “Of course I’m nervous\n",
      "about this. How can you not be? They’re your work friends.\n",
      "And what do you mean act natural ?”\n",
      "“They’re not my friends, Rose. We’re partners. And act\n",
      "natural means act natural. What else is it supposed to\n",
      "mean?”\n",
      "He was driving me into madness with his cold demeanor .\n",
      "“What diﬀerence does that make? You’re partners, so you\n",

      "that mean you’re gonna frown and be silent the entire\n",
      "evening? What am I supposed to do then?”\n",
      "“I don’t frown.” He frowned as he said it.\n",
      "Surprise, surprise.\n",
      "I tilted  my head. “Really? You’re gonna go with that?\n",
      "Why don’t we walk a few steps so you can stare  into the\n",
      "nice, shiny glass windows and see for yourself .”\n",
      "He sighed. “I’ll keep my frowning to a minimum,  if it’ll\n",
      "please you. It’ll be ﬁne. Come on. They’re not going to ask\n",
      "questions. Stop worrying. Remember , I told you, a potential\n",

      "Maybe I was worrying over nothing. Either way, I was\n",
      "going to go into that restaurant and try to look like a\n",
      "happily married couple with a man who never smiled. And\n",
      "eat. I’d also eat. If my mouth was full or I was ﬁxated on my\n",

      "to achieve either because I could already hear my stomach\n",
      "growling. Taking in a deep breath and letting it out, I\n",

      "Only the ﬁrst one was going to be this painful. After this\n",
      "one was over , I’d be a pro .\n",
      "“Okay . Okay , you know them. I trust you.” I smoothed\n",

      "When I met his eyes, he turned and walked away ,\n",

      "Stop looking, Rose. Stop staring. Blinking, I broke the weird connection and felt my face\n",
      "heat up.\n",
      "I cleared my throat. “ Yes?”\n",
      "He took a step closer . Standing too close for my comfort.\n",
      "“You look beautiful,” he said out of nowhere, softly , but\n",
      "loud enough that even though there was laughter and soft\n",
      "music spilling out from the dining area, there was no way I\n",
      "could’ve misheard that compliment. I ran my hand up and\n",
      "down my arm to get rid of the goose bumps his gaze and\n",
      "rough voice had caused. The way he’d just blurted it out, I\n",
      "wasn’t sure if he had been waiting for a good moment to\n",

      "actual compliment.\n",
      "“I…Thank you,” I whispered.\n",

      "Tilting my head back up, I met his gaze and slowly ,\n",
      "uncertainly placed my hand in his open palm for the ﬁrst\n",
      "time since the ceremony . His hand was warm as he gently\n",
      "closed his ﬁngers around mine. And my heart…my heart\n",
      "was having some issues.\n",
      "The number of times Jack Hawthorne smiled: zilch. CCHAPTER SEVEN\n",

      "followed the hostess and had to pull a bit when Rose\n",
      "didn’t move with me. As the woman guided us through the\n",
      "front tables and deeper into the restaurant, I quickly\n",
      "glanced down at Rose. She looked a little ﬂushed and\n",
      "unsettled with that small frown plastered on her face. I was\n",
      "unsettled too. Hell, maybe even more than her. The only\n",
      "diﬀerence was that I was better at hiding my emotions. You\n",
      "could read everything from just looking into her face, her\n",
      "eyes.\n",
      "Her dress, and the way she looked in the dress had\n",
      "blindsided me, that much  was apparent. And I hadn’t been\n",
      "able to keep my mouth shut. But that red ﬂush on her\n",
      "cheeks, the widening of her eyes, the goose bumps she had\n",
      "tried to hide. Those little facts were really interesting.\n",
      "“Are you okay?” I asked,  leaning down close to her ear\n",

      "restaurant.\n",
      "Jumping a little at my words, she looked at our clasped\n",

      "Before she could even respond, we reached the round\n",

      "the very unexpected but beautiful bride. Fred Witﬁeld,\n",
      "pleased to meet you.” He extended his hand to Rose, and I\n",
      "had to let go of her .\n",
      "I looked down at my hand. Still feeling the warmth and\n",

      "“I’m pleased  to meet you, too, Mr. Witﬁeld. Jack has said\n",

      "Ignoring me, Fred pulled out the chair next to the one I\n",
      "had just grabbed, thinki ng she’d sit to my left, with me\n",
      "between her and Fred. Since she had her back to me, she\n",

      "Plus, my dinner plans fell through, so I didn’t want to miss\n",

      "down her black clutch on the table, she leaned forward\n",
      "and, in the process, her breast pressed against my\n",

      "As the three  of them started to talk among themselves,\n",

      "and looked up into my eyes with surprise.\n",
      "“Got caught up in New York traﬀic. There was a small\n",

      "Please forgive me,” W es Doyle said as he rounded the table.\n",
      "“Good evening everyone.”\n",

      "passed with everyone ordering their drinks.\n",
      "“No menu?” Rose asked discreetly when everyone was\n",
      "distracted.\n",
      "“This restaurant is know n for the prix ﬁxe menu s. The\n",
      "chef changes it every few nights. He is supposed to be very\n",

      "She nodded and pulled away from me. Before I could\n",
      "catch her attention and ask what was wrong this time, the\n",
      "ﬁrst course arrived: seared scallops with an almond\n",
      "vinaigrette served on a half shell.\n",
      "Because Wes Doyle was someone who would be\n",

      "with their promises and assurances that he’d be on the list\n",
      "of people who were number one priority to the ﬁrm, but I\n",
      "was occupied with something else. I was watching Rose’s\n",
      "movements as she placed her napkin in her lap and stared\n",
      "at the scallo ps on her plate. Taking up her knife and fork,\n",
      "she cautiousl y cut a small piece and slowly brought it up to\n",
      "her lips. Oddly fascinated, I watched her chew it longer\n",
      "than was necessary and then force herself to swallow it\n",
      "down. Softly coughing, she reached for her glass and took a\n",
      "sip of water . For anyone looking at her, she’d look elegant\n",
      "as she enjoyed her dinne r, but to me, she looked like she\n",
      "was being forced to eat garbage.\n",

      "they all stared at me—everyone except Rose. “Don’t you\n",
      "want to add something?”\n",
      "It took me a second to shift gears. “I think Wes knows\n",
      "my opinions on this subje ct.” I glanced at Wes and he gave\n",

      "company from nothing in the last few years and had\n",
      "recently decided to change his law ﬁrm when his previous\n",

      "else—he’d either make the right decision or he wouldn’t.\n",
      "He had all the facts, and the rest of it was up to him.\n",
      "Everyone at the table focused on me, though my wife\n",
      "still didn’t. She stopped with the fork halfway to her lips for\n",
      "just a second, a slight hesitation, then resumed eating.\n",
      "Samantha cleared her throat. “I think what Jack is trying\n",
      "to—”\n",
      "Wes cut her oﬀ with a wave. “Oh, no. You don’t have to\n",
      "cover for him, Samantha . I like that he doesn’t hold back\n",
      "his thoughts. I need  that honesty . And yes, we talked more\n",
      "about this yesterday in his oﬀice, and he is right. I can’t\n",

      "However pointless it was, I understood his reservations.\n",
      "Everyone loved getting pampered, and he was someone\n",
      "who seemed to enjoy being the focus of attention.\n",
      "I took a few bites of my dinner and discreetly kept\n",
      "watching Rose even though I knew what a bad idea that\n",
      "was consider ing our situation. This was a work dinner , not\n",
      "the time to ogle my fake wife as if she was the most\n",
      "interesting thing in the world. But the more I couldn’t take my eyes oﬀ of her, the more I realized that she was doing\n",
      "her best to act like I wasn’t sitting right next to her. Then\n",
      "her quietness started to get to me as well. By helping her at\n",
      "the coﬀee shop I’d realized how much she loved to talk.\n",
      "About anything and everything. As much as she gave it her\n",
      "best shot she hadn’t quite managed to pull me into her\n",
      "conversations, not yet. The more she failed the harder she\n",
      "tried, as much as I admired her for it, I hadn’t lost my damn\n",
      "mind that much.\n",
      "I didn’t want to get used to her. Didn’t want to get close.\n",
      "Not anymore than I already was. That was not the plan. Not\n",
      "at all.\n",
      "When I couldn’t keep quiet anymore, I stopped thinking\n",
      "and placed my hand on her leg, my thumb and ﬁrst ﬁnger\n",
      "making contact with her bare skin. She jumped in her seat,\n",
      "her knee bumping the underside of the table, rattling the\n",
      "dishes. I forced myself to relax and tried to keep still. After\n",
      "apologizing to everyone profusely , she put down her knife\n",
      "and fork and ﬁnally looked back at me with murder in her\n",
      "eyes. If she’d had any idea how much I enjoyed her\n",
      "reactions, she would have acted diﬀerently just to annoy\n",
      "me. I was sure of it. I leaned toward her, and our shoulders\n",
      "and forearms lined up on the table as she met me in the\n",
      "middle.\n",
      "“What are you doing?” she whispered harshly .\n",
      "“Why are you avoiding me? What’s wrong?” I asked,\n",
      "pulling my hand away .\n",
      "She pulled back a little, but we were still huddled\n",
      "together as we looked into each other’s eyes as if in a\n",
      "challenge. Her brows drew together before she whispered\n",
      "back, “What are you talking about? How can I be avoiding\n",
      "you when I’m sitting right next to you? What’s wrong with\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "She straightened up, took another small bite from her\n",
      "plate, and started the slow chewing process again . I leaned\n",
      "closer and my lips got dangerously close to her neck, so much so that I got more  intimate with her smell. A fresh\n",
      "ﬂowery scent mixed with a fruit, maybe citrus. “I…” It took\n",
      "me a moment to remember what I was going to say and I\n",
      "faltered. “ Just relax a little. Don’t you like your appetizer?”\n",
      "I pulled back, and this time she leaned toward me.\n",
      "“I’m not a big fan of seafood. Is it too obvious?”\n",
      "After a quick glance at everyone else around the table to\n",
      "make sure we didn’t have  their attention, I turned my body\n",
      "completely toward Rose and put my arm around her chair\n",
      "again. My chest rubbed against her shoulder . I thought she\n",
      "would ﬂinch or even pull away , but this time she stayed put.\n",
      "We were supposed to be newlyweds. As much as I was\n",
      "trying my best to stay away from her when it was just the\n",
      "two of us, while around other people, I knew we needed to\n",
      "act more intimate if we wanted to seem believable as a\n",
      "couple. “Yes, Rose. The whole menu is seafood—why didn’t\n",
      "you say something?”\n",
      "“It’s a prix ﬁxe menu—I didn’t think we could change\n",
      "anything.”\n",
      "“Doesn’t mean you have to eat something you don’t\n",
      "like.” Still keeping my arm on her chair , I looked around\n",
      "the restaurant. “Stop forcing yourself to eat.” Not ﬁnding\n",
      "who I was looking for, I drew back from Rose, even\n",
      "managing to push my chair back a bit before she put her\n",
      "palm on my thigh. I paused and we both looked down to her\n",
      "hand on my slacks with surprise. She immediately  pulled it\n",
      "back. That was a good decision. That was a really good\n",
      "decision.\n",
      "In the spur of the moment, surprising myself and her, I\n",
      "believe, I leaned forward  and pressed a quick kiss on her\n",
      "cheek. It was something a husband would do before leaving\n",
      "the table. Her eyes widened slightly , just like it did when I’d\n",
      "complimented her , but she managed to keep it together .\n",
      "I rose.\n",
      "“Something wrong, Jack?” Fred asked, looking up at me.\n",
      "“Please continue,” I said to the table. “I’ll be right back.” It only took me a minute to track down someone who\n",
      "could change our order . Even though the restaurant only\n",
      "oﬀered set menus the elite of New York couldn’t stop\n",
      "talking about, with just the right amount of persuasion,\n",
      "they agreed to make a slight change just this once. When I\n",
      "got back to our table and sat down, Samantha and George\n",
      "were deep into their conversation with Wes while Rose was\n",
      "chatting with Fred, her cheeks ﬂushed.\n",
      "“Everything okay?” I asked, curious to hear what they\n",
      "were talking about.\n",
      "“You didn’t tell me she was related to the Colesons’,\n",
      "Jack. Gary had been with us for what ﬁve years ? I didn’t\n",
      "even know about her .”\n",
      "Rose gave me an apologetic look.\n",
      "“I only lived with them till I was eighteen. After that we\n",
      "didn’t see each other as much. Holidays and a random\n",
      "lunch or dinner every month or so. Gary was very busy with\n",
      "his ﬁrm and well, his own kids.”\n",
      "“It didn’t come up,” I explained brieﬂy , wanting to end\n",
      "the conversation.\n",
      "“Is that how you two met?”\n",
      "Rose gave me a look I couldn’t understand, but looked a\n",
      "lot like told you so, then turned back to Fred. “Yes. Well,\n",
      "kind of .”\n",
      "When the waiter came and started to collect the mostly\n",
      "empty dishes, Samantha piped up, taking advantage of the\n",
      "lull in their conversation with Wes. “When are we going to\n",
      "hear the proposal story? That’s what I’m waiting for .”\n",
      "“Proposal?” W es asked.\n",
      "“Jack and Rose just got married,” George explained.\n",
      "“Only a few weeks ago, I believe, right? It was a surprise to\n",
      "everyone in the ﬁrm.”\n",
      "Wes looked from me to Rose. “Congratulations! I had no\n",
      "idea. W e should’ve ordered champagne to celebrate.”\n",
      "“Thank you. We’re just getting used to it ourselves. It\n",
      "happened so fast. I mean we fell for each other so fast,” Rose said.\n",
      "“Give us all the details,” Fred chimed in. “So we can\n",
      "overlook the fact that none of us were invited to the\n",
      "wedding.”\n",
      "Rose laughed then turned  to look at me. “See, Jack, how\n",
      "nice—everyone wants to hear the proposal story .” When I\n",
      "just stared into her sparkling eyes, her smile tightened and\n",
      "she turned back to Fred. “Oh, I couldn’t. If I started, I’m\n",
      "afraid I wouldn’t stop. I have no brakes when it comes to\n",
      "talking about  Jack.” She turned to me and patted my arm, a\n",
      "little too hard if you asked me. Trying to hide my smile, I\n",
      "licked my lips and reached for my whiskey as she said, “ And\n",
      "this is a work dinner so I wouldn’t want to take over .”\n",
      "“Nonsense,” Samantha pushed. “We have plenty of time\n",
      "to talk about work. Jack, however , is a complete mystery\n",
      "when it comes to his private life. We’re dying to hear\n",
      "anything you’re willing to share.”\n",
      "Leaning back, I kept silent and waited to see how she\n",
      "would get herself out of this.\n",
      "Rose sent another pleadi ng yet angry look my way. “His\n",
      "proposal was actually very special to me, so if it’s okay, I’d\n",
      "like to keep that between us. That said, I’m sure Jack\n",
      "wouldn’t mind telling you how we met.” My hand was\n",
      "resting on the table when  Rose covered it with her own and\n",
      "patted it twice. “Right, honey?”\n",
      "The waiter returned with the second course— more\n",
      "seafood.\n",
      "Her hand seemed a little cold, or maybe it was just her\n",
      "nerves, but her ring bit into my skin. She had ﬁnally worn it\n",
      "without me having to prompt her. Turning my hand over,\n",
      "my palm against hers, I linked our ﬁngers together and our\n",
      "eyes met again. I didn’t realize it wouldn’t escape\n",
      "everyone’s notice and they would look at me in shock.\n",
      "“It’s not as exciting as you’re all thinking,” I warned. “I\n",
      "made a complete fool of myself and it somehow worked on\n",
      "her.” “Oh, now you have  to give us more than that.” Samantha\n",
      "placed her hand on my forearm. “Especially after saying\n",
      "the cold and calculated Jack Hawthorne made a fool of\n",
      "himself .”\n",
      "I reached for my whiskey  with my left hand, getting rid\n",
      "of Samantha ’s touch in the process. “If Wes doesn’t mind\n",
      "taking a little break from talking about work—”\n",
      "Wes cut in before focusin g on the plate in front of him.\n",
      "“Of course. Please go on.”\n",
      "After everyone’s seafood dishes were served, another\n",
      "waiter came  over and leaned between Fred and Rose to\n",
      "place a diﬀer ent one in front of her. It was larger and fuller\n",
      "than the other plates he had just delivered. “Creamy steak\n",
      "fettucine with shiitake mushrooms,” he explained quietly ,\n",
      "only for Rose’s ears.\n",
      "Her surprise d gaze ﬂew to mine. I wasn’t sure if she was\n",
      "aware of it, but her ﬁnge rs tightened around mine and she\n",
      "softly said, “Jack, you didn’t have to say anything. I’m the\n",
      "only one who—”\n",
      "When I was served the same pasta dish as her, she\n",
      "didn’t ﬁnish her sentenc e, instead giving me a big smile\n",
      "that reached her tired eyes for the ﬁrst time since we’d\n",
      "walked into the restaurant. She mouthed a silent thank\n",
      "you.\n",
      "My eyes dropped to her smile and I had to let go of her\n",
      "hand or otherwise... “ A better option than seafood, I hope.”\n",
      "“This is perfect, really . Thank you.”\n",
      "Fred broke into our little conversation. “Come on, you’ve\n",
      "been whispering all night with each other . You’ll have\n",
      "plenty of time to ﬂirt with each other once you leave here.\n",
      "Tell the story , Jack.”\n",
      "“I already told you it’s not that exciting, certainly not\n",
      "exciting as your story with Evelyn.”\n",
      "Fred turned to Wes. “He’s probably right. The ﬁrst time\n",
      "we met, my wife, who is also a lawyer , threatened to put me\n",
      "in jail, and she almost managed it, too .” “Oh, I’d love to hear about that,” Rose cut in, most likely\n",
      "trying to get them to stop talking about us so we wouldn’t\n",
      "have to come up with a lie. I had no intentions of lying, at\n",
      "least not about the entire thing. Also, I was curious about\n",
      "what her reaction would be.\n",
      "“I saw her at last year’s  Christmas party the Colesons\n",
      "were throwin g at their place. If I’m not mistaken, you were\n",
      "also there, right George?” I asked.\n",
      "George paused with his fork in the air and frowned,\n",
      "trying to recall the night.  “Wasn’t that when Gary called us\n",
      "to talk about one of the startups he was considering\n",
      "buying? It was after Christmas, though, wasn’t it?”\n",
      "“Yes, right after .”\n",
      "“I remember  the night. I thought you left before me,\n",
      "right after the meeting.”\n",
      "I nodded. “I was about to.” I met Fred’s eyes since he\n",
      "was the one who was the most curious about how Rose and\n",
      "I had met, and Rose looked just as interested in hearing it.\n",
      "“I was at their place before you, and I think Rose arrived\n",
      "seconds before me. Gary brieﬂy introduced us before we\n",
      "went up to his oﬀice to wait for you. At the end of the\n",
      "meeting, I left George with Gary and went downstairs. It\n",
      "was pretty crowded, actually, so I was trying to get out as\n",
      "quickly as possible. Then  my eye caught something in the\n",
      "kitchen and I stopped.”\n",
      "Rose’s eyebr ows crept up, waiting for the rest. Did she\n",
      "remember the night?\n",
      "I looked away from her. “I couldn’t walk away . Of all the\n",
      "things she could have been doing at a Christmas party, she\n",
      "was playing with a puppy , and I couldn’t take my eyes oﬀ of\n",
      "her. I watched for a minute or two, trying to decide if I\n",
      "should talk to her again or not. Introduce myself again or\n",
      "not. Then a little boy came and took the puppy from her,\n",
      "and she ﬁnally came out of the kitchen.” That was where I\n",
      "had to change my story . “And did you talk to her?” Samantha asked, clearly into\n",
      "it.\n",
      "“Yes, I did. I told her I wanted us to get married.”\n",
      "Everyone at the table started laughing. My eyes slid to\n",
      "Rose. “She didn’t say yes, of course. I tried everything I\n",
      "could think of, but it didn’t look like she was going to\n",
      "budge.”\n",
      "Rose’s confu sion disappe ared and her smile grew . “He\n",
      "really did try , maybe a little too hard, and the entire time he\n",
      "was so serio us, so conﬁdent, not even a hint of a smile on\n",
      "his face,” she added, joining in telling our made-up story .\n",
      "I placed my hand on her back and then changed my\n",
      "mind, pulled it back. “She thought I was insane, kept\n",
      "saying it over and over .”\n",
      "Rose looked around the table. “Who wouldn’t? But I\n",
      "couldn’t walk away , either . As much as I wasn’t taking him\n",
      "seriously , I think anyone would be insane to just walk away\n",
      "from Jack.” She paused. “My husband.”\n",
      "I took a long sip of the whiskey in front of me. “I wasn’t\n",
      "planning on letting you.” I cleared my throat and avoided\n",
      "her gaze. “I was sure if I came up with the right oﬀer, she’d\n",
      "at least say she’d consider it, but she turned me down each\n",
      "time. Eventu ally, she agreed to give me her number , but I’m\n",
      "afraid it was just so I would leave her alone. I took out my\n",
      "phone while standing right next to her and called to make\n",
      "sure she wasn’t giving me a fake one. The next day, I called\n",
      "her, and we started talking.”\n",
      "“He grew on me.” Rose looked at me while she spoke.\n",
      "“He was so diﬀerent than what I thought he would be. I\n",
      "didn’t know how to act around him.”\n",
      "“And?” Samantha prompted. “That’s it?”\n",
      "I turned to Samantha. “If you think I’m going to tell you\n",
      "what happened every day after that—”\n",
      "“There’s the Jack we know and love.” Samantha shook\n",
      "her head. “God, you got married! I still can’t wrap my mind\n",
      "around it.” “Be ready to tell this story from the very beginning to\n",
      "Evelyn, too. I’m not going to ruin it for her. You have to\n",
      "ﬁnish your sentences as you look into each other’s eyes,\n",
      "too, just like you did now. She lives for this stuﬀ, and she’ll\n",
      "be very pleased to hear that you’re happy , Jack.”\n",
      "After that, the table slid back into easy conversat ion as\n",
      "Rose and I mostly stayed silent. Once she had ﬁnished her\n",
      "plate, I leaned down to ask if it had been okay just so\n",
      "everyone would think we were having our own private\n",
      "conversation apart from them, like a newly married couple\n",
      "who were very much in love would do, but that was only\n",
      "once. Toward the end of the dinner , after dessert was\n",
      "served and the evening was ﬁnally winding down,\n",
      "Samantha spoke up.\n",
      "“Rose, I’m sorry we ignored you all night. So, tell us\n",
      "more about yourself . Are you working?”\n",
      "I sent Samantha a warning look, which she completely\n",
      "ignored.\n",
      "“I’m getting ready to open my own coﬀee shop,” Rose\n",
      "answered.\n",
      "“Oh, really? A coﬀee shop—how cute. Where is it?”\n",
      "“Madison A venue.”\n",
      "“When is the opening?”\n",
      "“Monday , hopefully . Everything is mostly done, thanks to\n",
      "Jack, of course.”\n",
      "Surprised, I glanced at Rose, and she gave me a small\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "“Jack?” Samantha marveled. “ What did he do?”\n",
      "“Apart from handling all the oﬀicial stuﬀ, he’d been\n",
      "dropping by after work and helping with the things I\n",
      "couldn’t do by myself .”\n",
      "Giving me a curious look, Samantha propped her head\n",
      "on her hand and leaned  forward. “What has he done so\n",
      "far?”\n",
      "As I turned the whiskey glass on the table, Rose’s eyes\n",
      "slid to me and then back to Samantha. “He painted the walls and helped me move some heavy things around.”\n",
      "“Wow. Jack painted?”\n",
      "“Samantha,” I said ﬂatly , giving her a second warning.\n",
      "“What?” she returned. “I’m making conversation. You\n",
      "can’t have her all to yourself . So, Rose, why didn’t  you hire\n",
      "professionals to deal with that stuﬀ?”\n",
      "“I have a budget, so I’m taking on the things I can do on\n",
      "my own.”\n",
      "“Jack, why are you not helping your wife with the money\n",
      "rather than oﬀering her actual labor?”\n",
      "I got as far as opening my mouth to cover for Rose, but\n",
      "she beat me to it. “Because his wife wants to do this on her\n",
      "own. Jack is respecting that, and him oﬀering his help with\n",
      "the manual labor stuﬀ means more to me than if he would\n",
      "have just thrown money at it to get things done. I’m a little\n",
      "old-fashioned like that, I think. It also means we get to\n",
      "spend more time together while working.”\n",
      "I hid my brief smile by taking a sip of my drink. So she\n",
      "wasn’t afraid  to show her claws when she was pushed. That\n",
      "was one of the things I liked about her. Only one of the\n",
      "things. I’d provoked her too many times and had been on\n",
      "the receiving end of her ﬁerceness.\n",
      "“Jack Hawth orne, the brilliant lawyer painting a coﬀee\n",
      "shop.” Samantha laughed. “I wish I could’ve seen that. I’m\n",
      "afraid marriage is already not agreeing with you, Jack.”\n",
      "Surprising me for the second time, Rose looped her arm\n",
      "around mine  and rested her chin on my shoulder . This time\n",
      "it was my turn to stiﬀen, but Rose ignored it and kept her\n",
      "eyes on Samantha. I downed my whiskey .\n",
      "“You really think so? Please don’t take this the wrong\n",
      "way, Samant ha. I’m sure you two had a great time while\n",
      "you were together—I mean, how could you not? Just look at\n",
      "him—but I’m very glad you actually don’t know Jack the\n",
      "way I do. I know he is a private person—that wouldn’t be a\n",
      "surprise to anyone, I don’t think—but boy am I relieved he is only like this with me. You’re gorgeous, but I guess I’m\n",
      "the lucky one who got the big prize.”\n",
      "I started coughing and reached for some water .\n",
      "George cleared his throat across the table.\n",
      "“Rose, I hope you’ll join us again another night, when\n",

      "With a smile on her face, she leaned closer . “What are\n",
      "you talking about? I’m just getting to know your wife.”\n",
      "My lips tightened. “You’re pissing me oﬀ, Samantha.\n",
      "That’s all you’re accomplishing here, and I think you\n",

      "“Oh come on, Jack. Don’t be so touchy . She is adorable,\n",
      "the complete  opposite of what I’d expect you would go for,\n",

      "Wes, telling him he wouldn’t regret his decision, I saw Rose\n",
      "discreetly run her hands over her bare arms. I looked at\n",
      "Samantha and noticed she was wearing a long-sleeved\n",
      "dress. As warm as it was inside the restaurant, Rose’s dress\n",
      "was still not appropriate for the temperature, inside or\n",
      "outside. Separating myself from the group, I walked back to\n",

      "Rose pulled my suit jacket tighter around herself and didn’t\n",
      "make any other commen ts. As we were all waiting for our\n",
      "cars in the entryway , I took Rose’s thin coat and draped it\n",
      "over my arm.\n",
      "“It’s cold outside,” she muttered quietly as she leaned\n",
      "her shoulder against mine so the others wouldn’t hear. She\n",
      "started to shrug my jacket oﬀ, but I put it back over her\n",
      "shoulders. My hand covering hers in the process.\n",
      "Our gazes held for a mom ent as I had to search for the\n",
      "right words. “I’m ﬁne, Rose.”\n",

      "“Well,” I repeated, not understanding what she was\n",

      "“Are you sorry or not?”\n",

      "“Well, she acted like a teenager ,” she mumbled as she\n",
      "stared out the window .\n",
      "I couldn’t argue with that so I didn’t. I awakened my\n",

      "more interested in me.”\n",
      "“I—what do you mean?”\n",

      "“If I rememb er correctly , you fell asleep in the car, and\n",

      "“You just said—”\n",
      "“I said you were warmer to him. You smiled and talked\n",

      "You have to talk to me.”\n",
      "I looked out the window and stayed quiet for the rest of\n",

      "explain that I was actual ly trying my best to talk to her as\n",
      "little as possible? That I had to do so?\n",
      "Once we were in the building, the doorman stood up.\n",
      "“Mr. Hawthorne, Mrs. Hawthorne. W elcome.”\n",
      "“Good evening, Steve,” Rose said, smiling at the older\n",
      "man. To my surprise, she stopped next to his station as I\n",
      "called down the elevator . “How are you feeling today? Your\n",
      "migraine is gone, I hope?”\n",
      "“Much better . Thank you for asking, Mrs. Hawthorne.”\n",
      "“I told you before, you can just call me Rose. Has it been\n",
      "a busy night?”\n",
      "The doorman’s eyes darted my way. “Erm, just the\n",

      "With my hands in my pockets, I watched their\n",

      "The elevator doors pinged open and she looked toward\n",
      "me. “Looks like our ride is here. Have a good night, Steve.\n",
      "I’ll see you in the morning?”\n",
      "“Yes, Mrs. Hawthorne. I’ll be here.”\n",
      "I held the doors open as she quickened her steps and got\n",
      "in the elevator . I stepped  in after her. We only managed to go up two ﬂoors in silence before my curiosity got the\n",
      "better of me. “ You know the doorman?”\n",
      "“Yes. I met him the ﬁrst morning I was leaving for work.\n",
      "We chat a bit in the mornings. Why?”\n",
      "“You’ve only been here for two weeks.”\n",
      "“So?”\n",
      "“I didn’t know his name,” I admitted uncomfortably .\n",
      "She hugged my jacket tighter around herself . “You never\n",
      "asked?”\n",
      "“I—no .” I didn’t want to admit that I hadn’t deemed it\n",
      "necessary , because I didn’t like how that made me sound.\n",
      "A mom ent later, I couldn’t stop myself from asking what\n",
      "had been on my mind for days now. “Do you still talk to\n",
      "Joshua, your ex-ﬁancé?” I blurted out at the same time the\n",
      "elevator doors opened, surprising both of us.\n",
      "Rose froze and gave me a startled look. I cursed myself\n",
      "for bringing it up, but after the dinner , I was too curious to\n",
      "ignore the idea completely .\n",
      "“No, I don’t talk to him. Haven’t talked to him or seen\n",
      "him since we broke up and I’m not planning to do it in the\n",
      "future either . Why would you ask that?” she ﬁnally asked,\n",
      "walking out of the elevator before I could answer . I\n",
      "followed her to our door .\n",
      "“I thought maybe you weren’t over him yet and that was\n",
      "why tonight was more diﬀicult.”\n",
      "“Trust me, I’m over him. I got over him pretty quickly ,\n",
      "considering. Tonight wasn’t diﬀicult, Jack. I’m not a\n",
      "stranger to awkward dinners. Tonight was…jus t a ﬁrst.\n",
      "That’s all. It was our ﬁrst dinner , too, and I actually think\n",
      "we did a pretty good job, don’t you agree? Still, I think we\n",
      "should work on getting to know each other a little bit, just\n",
      "talk about random stuﬀ. The next one should go down\n",
      "better . Also,  I thought you’d be distant when we were\n",
      "around other people—that’s why I was surprised when you\n",
      "touched me… so much.” She peered at the door. “Aren’t you\n",
      "gonna open it?” She still had my jacket on. “The key is in your right\n",
      "pocket,” I replied, reach ing for it before she could do it\n",
      "herself . She froze when my hand slid into the pocket and\n",
      "inadvertently touched her body through the lining. I\n",
      "stopped when my ﬁngers touched the keys and met her\n",
      "startled eyes. We stood exactly like that as I slowly pulled\n",
      "the keys out. Her throat moved as she swallowed , and she\n",
      "looked away ﬁrst, laughing awkwardly .\n",
      "Unlocking the door, I stood back so she could enter .\n",
      "Inside, after taking oﬀ her shoes, she slid my jacket from\n",
      "her shoulder s and handed it back to me. “Thank you.” She\n",
      "avoided my eyes, and I realized I didn’t like it.\n",
      "“You’re welcome.” I took it oﬀ her hands and neither one\n",
      "of us walked away from each other .\n",
      "I thoug ht she looked beautiful with her hair down and a\n",
      "little messy, her lips bare and her eyes still sparkling. I was\n",
      "heading straight for trouble if I was noticing the details.\n",
      "She smiled a little. “ Well, do you think we should—”\n",
      "My phone started ringing in my hand and she paused\n",
      "mid-sentence. Dragging my eyes away from her lips as her\n",
      "smile slowly faded, I looked down at the screen and my\n",
      "entire body tightened. Ignoring the call, I looked up at\n",
      "Rose. “I need  to take this. It’s about work and I might need\n",
      "to drop by the oﬀice for a bit.”\n",
      "“Now? A t this hour?”\n",
      "I clenched my jaw . “I’m afraid so .”\n",
      "“Okay then. I hope it’s not something too important.”\n",
      "“We’ll see. If I don’t see you around when I come back…\n",
      "Goodnight, Rose.”\n",
      "Riding the elevator down, I put my jacket back on and\n",
      "tried not to lose it. When I was back in the lobby, the\n",
      "doorman rose again.\n",
      "“Good eveni ng,” I said, trying my best not to sound\n",
      "angry .\n",
      "He looked startled for a second, making me feel even\n",
      "worse, but then gave me a quick smile and nodded. “Good evening, sir .”\n",
      "Before I could step out of the building, my phone started\n",
      "to go oﬀ again. Anger surged through my body and my\n",
      "ﬁngers tight ened around the phone. I had known I would\n",
      "eventually hear from him, but hadn’t thought it would\n",
      "happen so soon.\n",
      "Finding the cold bite of the air refreshing, I took a deep\n",
      "breath and caught a whiﬀ of Rose’s scent from my jacket.\n",
      "With her smell surrounding me, cursing myself , I answered\n",
      "the call.\n",
      "“What the hell do you want?”\n",
      "“How nice of you to ask. I think we need to have a talk,\n",
      "Jack. I imagine we have a lot of things to say to each other .”\n",
      "I gritted my teeth. “ When?”\n",
      "“How about now? Do you think you can get away from\n",
      "your beautiful bride for a late-night drink?”\n",
      "“Tell me where.”\n",
      "He was just a few blocks away from us, the son of a\n",

      "he was waiting. ICHAPTER EIGHT\n",
      "ROSE\n",
      "had known the last few days leading up to Monday , my\n",
      "opening day , would be hectic and maybe not so easy , and\n",
      "I wasn’t wrong. If Jack hadn’t been dropping by to pick me\n",
      "up, I would’ ve probably ended up sleeping on the ﬂoor\n",
      "inside the coﬀee shop just so I could make sure everything\n",
      "was ready . But, Jack…he had been…Jack was… a whole\n",
      "other subject.\n",
      "I had deemed Friday the second biggest day next to the\n",
      "opening day. It was the day the coﬀee shop’s sign was\n",
      "going to go up and all the people of New York would be\n",
      "able to see it.\n",
      "The black and white striped awnings had been installed\n",
      "around noon, and the sign was up only a few hours after\n",
      "that. I might have shed a few happy tears looking up at that\n",
      "thing.\n",
      "Around the Corner Coﬀee Shop .\n",
      "I knew I was oﬀicially freaking out about the opening\n",
      "when I started making lists for everything I could think of:\n",
      "what kind of freshly made sandwiches I would prepare, the\n",
      "ﬁrst week’s pastry menu , the ﬁrst day’s  pastry menu…the\n",
      "lists just went on and on. While I was happily busy with all\n",
      "of that, a slow drizzle  of rain had started, a pretty\n",
      "soundtrack in the background. As much as some people\n",
      "hated winter in New Y ork, I loved it. Jack showed up earlier than his usual time. I wasn’t\n",
      "surprised to see him when he showed up anymore, and it\n",
      "felt normal to have him in the space. I was looking forward\n",
      "to it even. It was the ﬁrst time I’d realized I was starting to\n",
      "enjoy his grumpy company . It’d been three weeks  since he\n",
      "had returned from London and started to come around\n",
      "every night. That was a lot of help I hadn’t expected to\n",
      "have, and I thought somewhere along the way something\n",
      "had changed between us.\n",
      "This time, before he could ask me, I asked for his help as\n",
      "soon as he stepped over the threshold.\n",
      "“Good, you’re here. Can you help me put the custom\n",
      "decals up on the windows?”\n",
      "He hesitated only for a moment, as if he was surprised.\n",
      "“Sure. Why not? I’m here anyway ,” he said at last, as if he\n",
      "wasn’t there  speciﬁcally to help me. As he took oﬀ his coat\n",
      "and then suit jacket, I settled in for my daily show: the\n",
      "sleeve roll-up. And what a show it was, every single night.\n",
      "You’d think it would get repetitive, but no . Just no .\n",
      "“Slow day at work?” I asked after wiping the invisible\n",
      "drool from the side of my mouth. He took the word Around\n",
      "from my waiting hands and climbed up the ladder until he\n",
      "could reach the top left corner of the window facing north.\n",
      "“What do you mean?”\n",
      "“You’re here early .”\n",
      "“I was in the neighborhood, had a quick meeting with an\n",
      "old client, so I thought I’d drop by .”\n",
      "I smiled up at him, but he wasn’t looking at me. “You\n",
      "seem to have so many meetings around here. There was\n",
      "another one the other day, right?” He frowned down at me,\n",
      "but before he could say anything, I pushed forward.\n",
      "“Anyway , as I keep saying every time you’re  here, I\n",
      "appreciate the help.”\n",
      "“I can see that.” He opened his palm, waiting for me to\n",
      "give him the next decal.\n",
      "I sighed. “I marked where that’s gonna go .” He didn’t reply or even acknowledge that I’d spoken, but\n",
      "placed the exactly where I’d marked for it to go .\n",
      "I took a deep breath. “So, how are you, Rose?” I started.\n",
      "“I’ve been pretty busy with work these last few days, and\n",
      "so have you. How are you? Did you manage to get a good\n",
      "night’s sleep last night? Are you excited about the\n",
      "opening?”\n",
      "Then I answ ered myself . “Aww, thank you so much for\n",
      "asking, Jack. I have a killer headache right now, but I can’t\n",
      "complain too much. I did manage to sleep the entire night\n",
      "last night, thank you very much for asking. It was one of\n",
      "the very few good sleeps I’ve had since moving in with you.\n",
      "I guess you went back to your oﬀice again last night—how\n",
      "late did you get in? I think I was fast asleep. Also, did you\n",
      "have a good day at work today?”\n",
      "Finished with the second decal, he glanced down  at me\n",
      "with that look of superiority featuring the arched eyebrow\n",
      "he had proba bly perfecte d in a meeting room or wherever .\n",
      "It wasn’t helping that he was literally standing over me.\n",
      "“What are you doing?” he asked, his hand open, waiting\n",
      "for the last one.\n",
      "I placed Corner  in his palm.\n",
      "“Just having a conversation,” I answered, shrugging.\n",
      "“With yourself?”\n",
      "“With you. Since you don’t ﬁnd me interesting enough to\n",
      "talk to, I’m making it easier for both of us and just doing it\n",
      "by myself. This way you won’t have to trouble yourself with\n",
      "asking random questions and making small talk. Plus,\n",
      "you’re up there, which means you can’t run away from me.\n",
      "So…win-win.”\n",
      "For a long time, we stared at each other , and I did my\n",
      "best to look innocent. Then he just sighed and shook his\n",
      "head as if I’d lost my mind and he was astonished with\n",
      "himself because he’d married this weird person willingly .\n",
      "He turned back to the window . “It’s not about not ﬁnding you interesting to talk to,\n",
      "Rose. You are probably the most interesting person I’ve\n",
      "ever met. I just don’t think we should get—nevermind I’ve\n",
      "had a long day , too—a long week, actually . That’s all.”\n",
      "And didn’t that made me feel like a jerk.\n",
      "“Oh,” I mumbled, shiftin g in place. “I’m sorry . I didn’t\n",
      "mean anything by it. Anything you want to share?”\n",
      "“No need to apologize. It’s nothing speciﬁc, just lots of\n",
      "meetings and phone calls.”\n",
      "“I baked some brownies to test out a recipe for opening\n",
      "day. Would you like some? Brownies always make me\n",
      "happy .”\n",
      "“Maybe after we ﬁnish this. Why Around the Corner?”\n",
      "I tried my best to keep my grin to a minimum but wasn’t\n",
      "sure if I quite managed it. “As Tom Hanks would say, the\n",

      "“Tom Hanks?”\n",
      "“I’m a big fan of the movie You’ve Got Mail. I love Meg\n",
      "Ryan’s character and her bookshop was called Around the\n",
      "Corner in the movie. It’s also simple, elegant, and sweet,\n",
      "not just because of the movie, but on its own. I like it.\n",
      "You’ve seen that movie, right? It’s a classic.”\n",
      "“Can’t say I have.”\n",
      "“No, Jack. Just no. No husband of mine can answer that\n",
      "question with a no. You have to watch it. Maybe we can\n",
      "watch it together one day when you’re free.”\n",
      "“Maybe.” He paused, and I thought that would be the\n",
      "extent of our conversation. “It’s good,” he muttered.\n",
      "“What?” I asked absently , looking out the window as\n",
      "people passed by with their umbrellas. The rain was\n",
      "starting to pick up.\n",
      "“The name—it’s good for a coﬀee shop.”\n",
      "That had my eyebrows rising and my attention going\n",
      "back to Jack. “Really? Y ou think so?”\n",
      "“Yes, it suits you for some reason, and it sounds like it\n",
      "has a good memory attac hed to it. You did a really good job around here, Rose. You should be proud.” He looked down.\n",

      "“Husband?” Sally blurted out in a slightly raised voice.\n",
      "“You’re married? You never said anything!” She grabbed\n",
      "my hand and inspected my naked ring ﬁnger . “No ring?”\n",
      "I inwardly winced and sent an apologetic look Jack’s\n",
      "way, but he had his hands in his pockets and his eyes were\n",
      "on the food, his expression completely unreadable as\n",
      "always.\n",
      "Sally was looking between Jack and me in baﬄement.\n",
      "“I took it oﬀ before I started baking. It’s in my bag. With\n",
      "everything going on, I forgot to put it back on.” I was explain ing it to Sally, but my eyes stayed on Jack\n",
      "the entire time. He looked up, and I oﬀered him a small\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "“It’s so beautiful,” I said, turning my gaze to Sally. “I\n",
      "keep taking it oﬀ when I’m working here because I don’t\n",
      "want to lose it. That’s why you didn’t see it before.”\n",
      "“I need to get back. Congratulations on the marriage,\n",
      "Rose. Nice to meet you, Jack,” Owen said before giving my\n",
      "shoulder a quick soft squeeze and disappearing into the\n",
      "kitchen. Sally just stood there.\n",
      "I looked up at Jack, he was staring at Owen’s back with\n",
      "a clenched jaw, but he averted his eyes before I could try to\n",
      "tell what he was thinking. Forcing myself out of this weird\n",
      "guilty feeling, I asked, “Would you like something to drink?\n",
      "Or eat?”\n",
      "“Yes. I want ﬁfteen…I don’t know , espressos, lattes, or\n",
      "just black coﬀee—whatever you recommend.”\n",
      "“Fifteen?”\n",
      "Finally , he looked at me. “I’ll take it to the oﬀice.”\n",
      "“Do you have a big meeting or something?”\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "Just one word, that one word… He was putting in a\n",
      "coﬀee order that big because he wanted to help me—again.\n",
      "“Oh, Jack, you don’t have  to do that.” This time I could\n",
      "feel the tears blurring my eyesight. It was going to happen.\n",
      "The edges of my lips started to tilt down, and I knew I\n",
      "wasn’t going to be able to stop it. “I’m going to hug you,” I\n",
      "blurted out.\n",
      "A line etched between his brows and his eyes ﬁnally\n",
      "came back to me. “ What?”\n",
      "Gently , I put the ﬂowers down on the counter and\n",
      "walked towa rd the end so I could make it to the other side\n",
      "through the small openin g. Before he could process it and\n",
      "quite possibly stop me, I closed my eyes and threw my arms\n",
      "around his neck, rising up on my tippy toes. To be fair, my movements had been slow . I’d given him time—enough time\n",
      "to stop me if he really wanted to .\n",
      "But he didn’t.\n",
      "After the initial second or two, his arms came around me\n",
      "and he returned the embrace. I rested my temple on his\n",
      "shoulder , drew in his wonderful and dizzying smell and\n",
      "whispered, “Thank you, Jack, for everything. For the coﬀee\n",
      "shop, all the help, the ﬂowers, the coﬀee order—\n",
      "everything. Thank you so much.” The tears made their way\n",
      "down my cheeks, and I slid my hands down from his neck\n",
      "and stopped when my palms met the lapels of his charcoal\n",
      "grey suit jacket. His arms dropped so he could push my\n",
      "hair away from my face and tuck it behind my ear. A shiver\n",
      "worked its way through my spine and I couldn’t move away\n",
      "from him.\n",
      "When his eyes landed on my face, his jaw was clenched,\n",
      "and I had no idea what was going through his mind. I just\n",
      "looked at his face, taking in his features, my favorite blue\n",
      "eyes and straight full lips. Still not a smile in sight. I\n",
      "dropped back to my soles and wiped my tears with the back\n",
      "of my hand. I looked around the coﬀee shop to the three\n",
      "tables that were occupie d. No one was looking at us, and\n",
      "even Sally had her back turned our way .\n",
      "I smiled at him, a big happy smile. “Okay . If you’r e sure\n",
      "you want that many , we’ll get started on them for you.”\n",
      "His eyes stayed on me. “I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t\n",
      "sure, Rose.”\n",
      "My smile widened. “Of course you are. Okay .” Walking\n",
      "around the counter , I asked, “Do you know what anyone\n",
      "drinks or are we just making a mix of everything?”\n",
      "He shook his head. “I don’t know what they drink.”\n",
      "“Right. Okay , we’ll do a few diﬀerent things. How do you\n",
      "want yours?”\n",
      "“Just…black with a splash of milk, if you can.”\n",
      "I picked up my ﬂowers, smiling. “Of course I can. I’ll\n",
      "collect all the vases and change out the artiﬁcial ﬂowers with these after you leave. I love them. Thank you, Jack.\n",
      "You have no idea what this means to me.”\n",
      "He cleared his throat but didn’t say anything. I helped\n",
      "Sally and we did a mix of everything: a few macc hiatos, a\n",
      "few lattes, four black coﬀees, and two matcha lattes, just in\n",
      "case someone preferred that. When Sally started on the\n",
      "extra black coﬀee, I gently took over. It wasn’t that it\n",
      "required any extra attention, but I wanted to be the one\n",
      "who prepared Jack’s coﬀee. When the whole order was\n",
      "ready , I started packing the free muﬀins and lemon bars.\n",
      "“These are free,” I expla ined without looking at Jack. “For\n",
      "the ﬁrst day, I’m giving everyone a lemon bar or a muﬀin,\n",
      "whatever they prefer .”\n",
      "“You don’t have to—” he started, but I was already\n",
      "closing the box.\n",
      "“They’re free, and you will take them. Otherwise I’m not\n",
      "giving you your coﬀee. Don’t argue with me.”\n",
      "“The roses look great on the door,” he said after a\n",
      "moment, and I looked at him.\n",
      "“Really?”\n",
      "“How did you put it up?”\n",
      "“I did it this morning, with Owen’s help.”\n",
      "His face hardened a little for some reason. “I woke up\n",
      "early to see if there was anything I could help you with, but\n",
      "I guess I missed you. When did you leave?”\n",
      "“Around ﬁve, I think.”\n",
      "“How did you get here that early?”\n",
      "Confused, I gave him a brief look over my shoulder and\n",
      "started on making another quick coﬀee. “Like I always do—\n",
      "I walked through Central P ark.”\n",
      "“On your own.”\n",
      "“Well, yeah. That’s how I get here. I won’t come in that\n",
      "early every day , but it was the ﬁrst day , so…”\n",
      "We fell silent as I ﬁnished the second cup I was\n",
      "preparing. “Everything is ready to go, Rose,” Sally said, sliding four\n",
      "bags toward me on the counter .\n",
      "“Okay . Thank you, Sally. Just one more second, Jack. I\n",
      "hope I’m not making you late.”\n",
      "“It’s ﬁne,” he muttered as a new customer walked in and\n",
      "started to look at the food and ask Sally questions. I\n",
      "welcomed the newcomer and put the lids on the two coﬀee\n",
      "cups I had prepared myself , grabbed two small paper bags\n",
      "that had our logo on the front, and quickly put two lemon\n",
      "bars inside each one along with an extra chocolate muﬀin\n",
      "in one of them. “Okay . We can go,” I announced, smiling at\n",
      "Jack.\n",
      "He held out a credit card to me between two ﬁngers. “I\n",
      "hope you don’t forget to ask for payment from all your\n",
      "customers.”\n",
      "“My husband gets a free pass,” I pointed out softly as we\n",
      "stared at each other and I ignored the credit card. Sally\n",
      "walked behind me toward the espresso machine. “Ready to\n",
      "go?” I asked Jack.\n",
      "“Rose, I’m not taking anything if I’m not paying for it.”\n",
      "My smile started to melt oﬀ my face as he spoke.\n",
      "“It’s your ﬁrst day—if you start giving away free coﬀee\n",
      "to everyone you know on the ﬁrst day, you won’t have this\n",
      "coﬀee shop for very long.” There went the rest of my smile.\n",
      "“I wouldn’t have ordered so many if I’d thought you weren’t\n",
      "going to accept payment for it.”\n",
      "He extended the credit card farther forward and I\n",
      "reluctantly took it.\n",
      "Before pushing in the amount, I glanced up at him. “I’m\n",
      "not taking payment for your coﬀee, Jack. I’m…just not.”\n",
      "We had a short-lived but intense staring match where I\n",
      "came out as the winne r. “Okay . Okay , that’s ﬁne,” he\n",
      "agreed. “I didn’t mean to make you upset, Rose.”\n",
      "“It’s okay .”\n",
      "I handed him the four bags and the card. Then I took the\n",
      "two coﬀee cups and the extra small bag myself . “Be careful not to tip the cups,” I warned as Jack glanced inside the\n",
      "bags. “I’ll be right back, Sally!”\n",
      "I followed him out to the curb where Raymond was\n",
      "waiting. He rushed out as soon as he saw us coming with\n",
      "our hands full. He opened the door for Jack and waited.\n",
      "“You should put the bags  on the ﬂoor, Jack, keep  them\n",
      "between your feet so they don’t make a mess in the car.”\n",
      "Jack leaned down and arranged everything carefully as I\n",
      "turned to Raymond. “I’m sorry , I don’t know how you take\n",
      "your coﬀee, but I made you what I made for Jack, black\n",
      "with a splash of milk, and if you want, there are sugar\n",
      "packets in the bag too.” I handed him the cup and the small\n",
      "paper bag. “And there is a lemon bar in this. I made it\n",
      "myself . It’s good.”\n",
      "“Thank you, Rose, and congratulations on your new\n",
      "place. It looks amazing.”\n",
      "It was the ﬁrst time he’d called me Rose. “Thank you so\n",
      "much, Raymond, and you’re welcome.” I beamed after him\n",
      "as he walked back to the driver’s side.\n",
      "“And these are yours,” I said as I handed my husband\n",
      "the other coﬀee cup and paper bag, feeling a little shy all of\n",
      "a sudden. “I put a lemo n bar and a chocolate muﬀin in\n",
      "yours because I wasn’t sure what you liked, but if you don’t\n",
      "like —”\n",
      "“You made the muﬀin, too?” he asked, peeking into the\n",
      "bag.\n",
      "“No, Owen baked the muﬀins. I made the lemon bars\n",
      "and the sandwiches. He is…” Did I need to give him an\n",
      "explanation? He hadn’t asked, but I felt like I wanted to.\n",
      "“Owen, I mean, he’s my friend. Barely even a friend. We\n",
      "worked at this café two years ago and talked every now and\n",
      "then after that. So, I just wanted you to know . He is just a\n",
      "friend.”\n",
      "“I don’t need an explanation about your friends, Rose.”\n",
      "Despite his harsh answer , I thought I saw his shoulders\n",
      "relax a fraction. I could live with that. “Okay .” Not sure what to do with my hands, I just stood\n",
      "there.\n",
      "“Did anyone unwanted show up today?”\n",
      "I arched a brow . “Anyone unwanted? You mean like\n",
      "Bryan? No, he didn’t. Neither did Jodi.”\n",
      "“Good. I had a quick talk with him. He won’t bother you\n",
      "again.”\n",
      "“What? When?”\n",
      "“After he showed up here. It doesn’t matter now .”\n",
      "He had a coﬀee cup in one hand and the bag in the\n",
      "other . With his tailored suit and that I’m not exactly sure\n",
      "what I’m doing here look on his face, he looked so…so\n",
      "grumpy and adorable that I couldn’t stop myself from\n",
      "giving him another hug.\n",
      "Since his hands were full, he couldn’t do anything but\n",
      "stiﬀen this time. Before I realized what I was doing , I found\n",
      "myself pressing a hand on his cheek and kissing him on the\n",
      "other side, surprised by my sudden act, I lingered. When I\n",
      "let go of him and backed up, he was looking straight into\n",
      "my eyes. I ﬂushed but managed a smile. “Thank you, for the\n",
      "ﬂowers and the coﬀee order . That you’d even think of\n",
      "buying coﬀee for your work friends—and they’re not even\n",
      "your friends—and only because it’s my ﬁrst day…it means\n",
      "so much to me.”\n",
      "“I’m not doing it for you.”\n",
      "“You keep telling yourse lf that. You’re hating it all the\n",
      "way, but you’re starting  to get used to me.” When his\n",
      "steady gaze became too unsettling to return, I gave him a\n",
      "weird wave, mumbled something like, “Have a good day at\n",
      "work,” then rushed back into the coﬀee shop.\n",
      "My cheeks slightly ﬂushed—maybe from the cold\n",
      "outside, or maybe because of Jack’s gaze on me—I made it\n",
      "back to Sally’s side. When the thing that was ﬂuttering\n",
      "wildly inside my chest became too much to ignore, I looked\n",
      "back outside to see Jack standing on the curb and looking\n",
      "inside. Had I really just kissed him and lingered?  And then run\n",
      "away like a school girl?\n",
      "I thought my cheeks ﬂushed even more, so to forget all\n",
      "about it, I started to collect all the little vases on the tables,\n",
      "took my roses into the kitchen, and started on making my\n",
      "coﬀee shop even more lively and beautiful with a big,\n",
      "permanent smile on my face.\n",
      "WHEN  THE  CLOCK hit seven PM, I was drained. I was happy ,\n",
      "but the excitement had gotten to me. Owen had left right\n",
      "after lunch when he was done with his work, and Sally had\n",
      "left just half an hour ago . We had sold well over ﬁfty cups of\n",
      "coﬀee, crush ing my goals. It’d been just a bit over the one\n",
      "hundred mark, actually .\n",
      "A knock on the door made me stop what I was doing,\n",
      "which was getting the last few bits of baked goods into\n",
      "containers and then in the fridge. I’d dimmed the lights in\n",
      "the coﬀee shop right after Sally left and had ﬂipped the\n",
      "open sign to closed, as well as locking up. Holding the\n",
      "doorframe, I peeked toward the door. When I saw Jack\n",
      "standing in the rain, I put the brownie plate down and ran\n",
      "to the front of the coﬀee shop.\n",
      "“Jack, what are you doing here?” I asked as soon as I\n",
      "opened the door . “It’s raining.”\n",
      "“Really? I hadn’t noticed.”\n",
      "I took a deep breath to keep myself from rolling my eyes\n",
      "at him. “You should’ve called from the car so I could open\n",
      "the door for you.”\n",
      "“I did, actually , but you didn’t answer .”\n",
      "I winced and just stood in front of him, not sure what to\n",
      "do now that he was standing right in front of me and we\n",
      "were alone. “I’m sorry , it’s in my bag. I haven’t checked it\n",
      "the entire day. But, still, I didn’t expect to see you here.” I watched him as he ran his hand through his wet hair,\n",
      "somehow making it look like the rain had styled it for him—\n",
      "whereas the minute I stepped out into that rain, I knew I\n",
      "was going to look like a drowned rat.\n",
      "“Right, beca use it’s not like I’m here every night,” he\n",
      "said before looking around the shop. Apparently that was\n",
      "all the explanation he was ready to give. “Are you going to\n",
      "let me in, or do you want me to stay out in the cold?”\n",
      "“Oh, shoot, come in. Sorry .” I opened the door wider and\n",
      "he stepped in. “Since you came in this morning, I thought\n",
      "maybe you’d skip the pickup today .” I smiled as he brushed\n",
      "oﬀ the rain from the arms of his coat.\n",
      "“Looks like I didn’t.” I just stared at him. “Ready to\n",
      "leave?” he asked, eyes coming back to me.\n",
      "“You’re really gonna make me ask?”\n",
      "Distractedly , he kept brushing rain oﬀ of his coat as his\n",
      "forehead creased. “ Ask me what?”\n",
      "I raised my brows. “The coﬀee, the lemon bar? Did\n",
      "everyone like it? More importantly , did you even eat it? Did\n",
      "you like it?”\n",
      "I waite d with bated breath, which was stupid. Almost all\n",
      "the customers had commented on how much they’d loved\n",
      "everything—the space, the coﬀee, the food, the roses\n",
      "outside. Even so, hearing what Jack thought felt important.\n",
      "I cared.\n",
      "He ﬁnally stopped messing with his coat and took a good\n",
      "look at me. “Everyone loved it.”\n",
      "“That’s all you’re going to give me? Are you being\n",
      "serious?”\n",
      "The creases on his forehead got deeper . “I’m always\n",
      "being serious.”\n",
      "I laughed. “Yes, yes you are. I think you loved it, but\n",
      "you’re just too proud to say it out loud.” I didn’t give him an\n",
      "opportunity to answer . “Do you mind sitting and waiting for\n",
      "a few minutes? I need to do a few more things in the\n",
      "kitchen, but after that we can leave. I can make you a coﬀee for while you wait?” My eyes still on him, I started\n",
      "backing away toward the kitchen.\n",
      "With his coat still on, he pulled up the closest chair and\n",
      "sat down, his eyes on me. “I’m good. You go take care of\n",
      "whatever you need to take care of .”\n",
      "I gave him another overly bright smile and disappeared\n",
      "through the doorway . Grabbing the brownie plate from the\n",
      "counter , I raised my voice so he could hear me.\n",
      "“Did you have a good day?”\n",
      "I stopped transferring the brownies and waited for his\n",
      "answer .\n",
      "“It was ﬁne,” he said ﬁnally. “Busy and long, as usual.\n",
      "Fred wanted me to congratulate you on his behalf .”\n",
      "“Oh? That’s so nice of him.”\n",
      "I waited another few seconds and when the follow-up\n",
      "question didn’t come, I answered it for myself . “Mine was\n",
      "good. Thank you so much  for asking. It was just like yours,\n",
      "actually—busy and long.” I paused for a second. “Ah, thank\n",
      "you so much, Jack. I hope it becomes a usual thing, too.\n",
      "You’re so right.”\n",
      "Another quiet few seconds, and then his delicious voice\n",
      "came from very close.\n",
      "“What do you think you’re doing?”\n",
      "No, not delic ious—it wasn’t delicious as in delicious , but\n",
      "it felt like it was delicious as it touched my skin. It was just\n",
      "a norm al male voice, nothing to get excited about, just a\n",
      "little thick and rumbly and smooth at the same time.\n",
      "I knew exactly where he was, but I still looked to where\n",
      "he was leaning against the doorframe. His coat was oﬀ, but\n",
      "he was wearing his suit jacket, hands in the pock ets of his\n",
      "pants. Maybe it was for the better that there would be no\n",
      "forearm porn today , because if that had happened, I wasn’t\n",
      "sure how I would react anymore.\n",
      "“Just talking to you.”\n",
      "“You mean to yourself .”\n",
      "“No, I mean to you. I really enjoy talking to you.” He stared at me boldly and I fell into the blue trap.\n",
      "“Can I help you in here?” he asked.\n",
      "For some reason, I ﬂushed. It was a pretty small space\n",
      "for two peop le. Sure, I worked with Owen just ﬁne, but we\n",
      "baked across  from each other and I wasn’t attracted to him\n",
      "at all. I could n’t exactly keep Jack at arm’s length when we\n",
      "were carrying pastries to the fridge.\n",
      "“Nope. I’m good.” I mean , it wasn’t the ﬁrst time he had\n",
      "oﬀered his help, and if he did help, he would actually…\n",
      "but…no . No, skipping the forearm porn was the smart\n",
      "choice here. Deﬁnitely . “Just a few more things I need to…\n",
      "ah…do, then I’m ready . If you have somewhere else to be, I\n",
      "don’t want to make you wait. I’ll be done in—”\n",
      "He crossed his arms, his shoulder still holding him up\n",
      "against the doorframe. “No . I’m good right here, too .”\n",
      "I didn’ t even attempt to stop the smile growing on my\n",
      "face, and to be honest, that weird sense of pleasure his\n",
      "words had caused was completely uncalled for. I bit my\n",
      "lower lip just to stop my mouth from curving up.\n",
      "Considering I hadn’t even stolen one genuine smile from\n",
      "him, I was giving mine away too easily for my liking. When\n",
      "the brownies were done, I grabbed my cheeks and pushed\n",
      "them in. “I’ve been smili ng so much today , my cheeks are\n",
      "hurting.”\n",
      "“How good was it?”\n",

      "hand. “Thank you for helping my wife. Is there anything we\n",
      "can do for you?” We shook hands as he gave Rose a once-over . “It’s\n",
      "nothing. I’m just glad I was there to help.” He glanced at\n",
      "his watch. “I need to go, but she took a bad fall so you\n",
      "might want to have someone look—”\n",
      "My jaw clenched. “I’ll take care of her. Thank you\n",
      "again.”\n",
      "Rose shuﬄe d closer to me. “I have a coﬀee shop on\n",
      "Madison Avenue, Around the Corner . If you’re ever around,\n",
      "please drop by—I’d like to buy you a cup of coﬀee as a\n",
      "thank you.”\n",
      "“Sure. It’s not safe for you to walk around the park this\n",
      "early in the morning, so be careful in the future.”\n",
      "“I will. Again, thank you.”\n",
      "Giving us a nod and a quick wave, Henry jogged  away\n",
      "toward the west side.\n",
      "Rose took a deep breath and sighed. I looked her over\n",
      "from head to toe once again, trying to assess the situation.\n",
      "“I feel ﬁne now, and when Henry insisted I should call\n",
      "someone, I couldn’t protest. I mean, I was going to call\n",
      "Owen, but he probably already started on the baking and I\n",
      "didn’t want to take him from—”\n",
      "“Rose, stop talking.” I picked up her hand, the one she\n",
      "was holding her phone with, and she winced. I frowned\n",
      "down at her, gently picking up the phone so I could hold\n",
      "her hand and look at the damage. The heel of her palm was\n",
      "scraped and there was some blood.\n",
      "“Give me your other hand.”\n",
      "“It’s ﬁne.”\n",
      "My mouth tightened and I kept my hand open, waiting\n",
      "for her. Reluctantly she held up her palm—the same\n",
      "scrapes, more blood.\n",
      "“The ring is ﬁne.”\n",
      "“Do I look like I care about a fucking ring?” I snapped,\n",
      "too busy turning her hand over and gently pressing on her\n",
      "wrists to see if she was hurting.\n",
      "“Nope, you don’t. How did you get here so fast anyway?” “I ran.”\n",
      "She was quiet for a few seconds as I examined her skin.\n",
      "“You ran?”\n",
      "I gave her a long look that made her lips twitch which\n",
      "broke my concentration.\n",
      "“It’s just a bunch of surface scrapes. It’ll be ﬁne once I\n",
      "wash and clean them, Jack. I’m ﬁne. Really . No need to\n",
      "worry .”\n",
      "“I’m not worrying.”\n",
      "I ran my thumb across her palm, dislodging a few small\n",
      "stones that were sticking  to her skin. She was right—they\n",
      "weren’t so bad that I would consider taking her to the\n",
      "hospital, but I had considered it. There was more dirt on\n",
      "her jeans so I assumed there were more scrapes at unseen\n",
      "places.\n",
      "I let go of her hands, my eyes scanning her body again.\n",
      "I watch ed as she held her hands up to her chest, rubbed\n",
      "the center of one, and winced.\n",
      "“How did you managed to fall?”\n",
      "Shifting her feet, she looked up at me under her lashes.\n",
      "“I was feeling a little dizzy and I fricking tripped on\n",
      "something. I don’t even know what it was, I wasn ’t paying\n",
      "attention and then my ankle turned and I fell hard on my\n",
      "knees and hands. Henry  helped me up, and I was a little\n",
      "shaky so he made me call someone. I couldn’t think of\n",
      "anyone but you. It’s nothing, I just need a little help\n",
      "walking, that’s all.”\n",
      "I couldn’t think of anyone but you.\n",
      "That shut me up for a second or two as I stared at her .\n",
      "“You’re ﬁne?” I asked with my brows raised. I reached\n",
      "for her hands and gently held them between us. Her palms\n",
      "weren’t dripping with blood, but the scrapes  weren’t\n",
      "nothing either . “This isn’t nothing. Who knows what your\n",
      "knees look like.”\n",
      "“I’m sure they look ﬁne. It does hurt a little when I bend\n",
      "them, but only because I landed pretty hard on them, not because they’re scraped.”\n",
      "Kneeling down, I looked at the foot she was tryin g her\n",
      "best not to put weight on. I rolled up her jeans once and\n",
      "gently wrapp ed my hand around her ankle. Even this. Even\n",
      "an innocent touch like this was starting to aﬀect me.\n",
      "“Jack?” Rose whispered and snapped me back from my\n",
      "thoughts.\n",
      "When I pressed on a spot that was slightly red, she\n",
      "jerked it back.\n",
      "“Yes,” I said dryly as I stood up. “You’re completel y ﬁne.\n",
      "Can you walk?\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "“Okay . Let’s see how you walk.” Slipping her bag oﬀ her\n",
      "shoulder , I turned left, but she turned right. I stopped.\n",
      "“Where do you think you’re going?”\n",
      "“To work, of course,” she replied with a small frown\n",
      "forming between her brows.\n",
      "“I don’t think so .”\n",
      "“Excuse me?”\n",
      "“Rose, I need to take a look at what else is hurt. We’re\n",
      "going home.”\n",
      "“I don’t think so. I’m already late so if you’re not gonna\n",
      "help, I’m completely ﬁne walking on my own.”\n",
      "She turned, getting ready to walk away .\n",
      "“Because that turned out so well for you the last time,\n",
      "right?” I asked, stopping her in her tracks before she could\n",
      "take a step.\n",
      "Her eyes were narrowed when she faced me again . “Yes,\n",
      "actually , it’s worked out just ﬁne these last few weeks. So,\n",
      "I’m thinking it’s gonna be just ﬁne now too .”\n",
      "I gritted my teeth and kept my mouth shut. She didn’t\n",
      "give me a chance to say anything anyway before she turned\n",
      "around to leave again. Her ﬁrst step looked normal, but the\n",
      "second didn’t look smooth enough. She was favoring her\n",
      "left leg. What was I gonna do with her? Without even realizing it, she had just crumpled another wall I’d tried my\n",
      "best to put up.\n",
      "Still just a few steps separating us, I called out after her.\n",
      "“Your bag.”\n",
      "She stopped  and looked at me over her shoulde r, her\n",
      "features tight. “ What?”\n",
      "Staying silen t, I raised my eyebrow and showed her the\n",
      "bag in my hand. She limped back the few steps  she had\n",
      "taken and held her hand up, eyes boring into mine.\n",
      "She was something else.\n",
      "I studi ed her face, thinking maybe I could intimidate her,\n",
      "but she wasn’t giving an inch. I’d gotten to know her pretty\n",
      "well, and I knew she wouldn’t give in, no matter what I said\n",
      "or did. Shaking my head, I threw her bag on my left\n",
      "shoulder and tucked her arm around my right.\n",
      "She stiﬀene d next to me and tried to pull away. I\n",
      "covered the back of her hand with my right hand  to keep\n",
      "her still.\n",
      "“I’m not going back to your apartment, Jack,” she said\n",
      "through gritted teeth as a group of runners and their two\n",
      "dogs forced us to move to the edge of the road.\n",
      "“It’s not my apartment anymore, is it?” I asked\n",
      "distractedly . “It’s supposed to be ours. Get used to it so you\n",
      "don’t let something like that slip around your cousins or\n",
      "other people.”\n",
      "“Are you taking me to work or—”\n",
      "“We’re going to your precious coﬀee shop, goddam mit,”\n",
      "I burst  out, and then I tried my best to gentle my voice.\n",
      "“You called me for help and I’m helping. Stop arguing with\n",
      "me and try to walk instead.”\n",
      "That shut her up. She gave me another look and bit\n",
      "down on her lip as she grabbed my arm with her left hand\n",
      "too. After a few slow steps, she rested a bit more of her\n",
      "weight on me.\n",
      "She was as stubborn as a mule. Another thing that made\n",
      "me like her more. “How are your knees?” I asked, completely aware of\n",
      "how surly I sounded.\n",
      "Another ﬂeeting look at me. “They feel a little tight. I’m\n",
      "sure it’ll go back to normal in a few hours. We’re closer to\n",
      "the coﬀee shop than our apartment anyway .”\n",
      "I gritted my teeth, glaring at the people walking past us.\n",
      "“Right.” After a few minutes of shuﬄing and resting and\n",
      "wincing, I couldn’t take it anymore. “Put your arm around\n",
      "my neck,” I ordered. When she hesitated, I sighed  and did\n",
      "it myself .\n",
      "“I’m shorter than you, so we can’t walk like that—Jack!”\n",
      "“What?” I asked, grunting softly when I had her up in\n",
      "my arms.\n",
      "“Have you lost your mind?”\n",
      "I started walking at a normal pace, holding her tightly\n",
      "against my chest as she slid her other hand around my\n",
      "neck.\n",
      "“Jack, you don’t have to carry me, I can walk. Put me\n",
      "down.”\n",
      "“No. You can’t put weight on your left leg. You’re gonna\n",
      "make it worse.”\n",
      "“I can. I’ve been walking with your help. Jack, I can.”\n",
      "“With the speed we were going, you’d reach your coﬀee\n",
      "shop at noon. What’s the problem? I’m doing all the work\n",
      "here, and I thought you were in a hurry to get there.”\n",
      "“Jack,” she growled, her eyes shooting daggers at me. I\n",
      "kept my eyes forward and continued walking. “Jack, I’m\n",
      "warning you, you’re not going to carry me all the way to\n",
      "the coﬀee shop.”\n",
      "“I’m not? If you say so, I’m sure it must be true.”\n",
      "“Everyone is staring at us,” she whispered.\n",
      "“We’ve only passed two people.”\n",
      "“And both of them were looking at us like we were crazy .\n",
      "I’m not gonna be in your arms while we’re crossing 5th\n",
      "Avenue with all those people around. Everyone will look at\n",
      "us. The traﬀic! And Madison A venue!” “You will.”\n",
      "“I’m really regretting calling you right now .”\n",
      "“I couldn’t tell.”\n",
      "I was enjoying it too much.\n",
      "When trying  to push oﬀ of me so she could get down\n",
      "didn’t work, she gently slapped my shoulder with her\n",
      "injured hand and then winced.\n",
      "I clenched my jaw so I wouldn’t smile. “Stop squirming.\n",
      "You’re not the only one who likes to get to work on time.”\n",
      "“Fine, have it your way. You’ll put me down once we exit\n",
      "the park.” Since we were almost out of it anyw ay, a lot\n",
      "more people  started to pass us, some of them snickering,\n",
      "some of them giving us disapproving looks. I ignored them,\n",
      "but Rose wasn’t exactly good at that.\n",
      "“Hi,” she shouted to a stranger walking by and staring\n",
      "at her . “I just hurt my leg, that’s why he’s carrying me. He’s\n",
      "my husband. Everything is good.” The woman just shook\n",
      "her head and quickened her steps. “Jack,” she groaned, her\n",
      "voice muﬄed by her face being buried in my neck. “They\n",
      "think we’re crazy . I’ll never be able to walk through here\n",
      "again.”\n",
      "I hiked  her up and, with a surprisingly satisfying squeak,\n",
      "she held tighter on my neck. That was fun.\n",
      "“If you don’t want them to think you’re crazy , I’d suggest\n",
      "stop shouting at them. And you aren’t going to walk\n",
      "through here again anyway , so stop complaining.”\n",
      "She lifted her head oﬀ my chest. “What the hell are you\n",
      "talking about?”\n",
      "“I’ll talk to Raymond. He’ll come earlier and take you\n",
      "across then he’ll come back and take me to work. It was\n",
      "stupid of you to walk through the park while it was barely\n",
      "light out. You’re lucky you didn’t break your leg or get\n",
      "mugged.”\n",
      "I could feel her eyes on me, but I didn’t look at her .\n",
      "“I have pepper spray in my bag. And I don’t need a\n",
      "driver . I’m not the kind of person who has a driver . No oﬀense to Raymond—I like him, and he’s a nice guy—but\n",
      "I’m not like you.”\n",
      "Finally , we made it out onto 5th, where there were a lot\n",
      "more people. “Thanks for pointing that out. I hadn’t\n",
      "noticed.”\n",
      "“I’ve been taking care of myself all my life, Jack,” she\n",
      "said softly .\n",
      "“I know and you’ve done an amazing job. Just because\n",
      "you can take care of yourself , you’re not supposed to let\n",
      "anyone else help you? I’m sorry for committing this atrocity\n",
      "against you.”\n",
      "“You’re insane.”\n",
      "“I think we covered that the ﬁrst day we met. No need to\n",
      "rehash it all over again.”\n",
      "“You’re also unbelievable, do you know that?” she asked\n",
      "softer .\n",
      "“I can imagine,” I murmured, a little distracted.\n",
      "Standing next to a group of people, I waited for the light to\n",
      "change.\n",
      "“He is my husband,” Rose announced to the group. “I\n",
      "fell.”\n",
      "There were some snicker s from the school girls on our\n",
      "left when I hiked her up again and Rose squeaked.\n",
      "As we made it across, she started up again, and I sighed.\n",
      "“We’re almost there—”\n",
      "“You can hold on for a few more minutes then.”\n",
      "“Jack.”\n",
      "“Rose. Y ou know some women would ﬁnd this romantic.”\n",
      "“I’m not some women.”\n",
      "“You’re telling me,” I grunted.\n",
      "Luckily , there was silence after that until we reached the\n",
      "front door of her beauti ful coﬀee shop. I gently put her\n",
      "down under the roses and handed her bag to her. Keeping\n",
      "her gaze averted, she searched for a key and opened the\n",
      "door. I could see the light in the kitchen from where we\n",
      "were standing, meaning the guy, the part-time worker , was already there. With jerky movements, she unlocked the\n",
      "door and walked in.\n",
      "“Let’s take a look at your knees while I—”\n",
      "Before I could ﬁnish my sentence and follow her in, she\n",
      "slammed the door in my face and reset the alarm. As I\n",
      "stared after her, she didn’t even look back. Still limping,\n",
      "she disappeared into the kitchen.\n",
      "Shocked and absurdly amused, I stood there looking into\n",
      "the empty coﬀee shop for another ten seconds. Then,\n",
      "turning around, my hand s in my pockets, I walked for a\n",
      "block or two. I eventually  hailed a cab and headed  home so\n",
      "I could get to work myself . I wasn’t sure what to feel about\n",
      "the smile that stayed on my face the entire morning.\n",
      "LATER , I walked into my oﬀice and greeted Cynthia.\n",
      "“Good morning, Jack.”\n",
      "I leane d against the edge of my desk. “Good morning.\n",
      "Any changes in my schedule for today?”\n",
      "Her forehead creased, and she looked down at her\n",
      "tablet. “No, no changes.”\n",
      "“Then I need you to clear everything between…” I\n",
      "checked my watch, trying to decide what time would be\n",
      "better . “Eleven-thirty and two-thirty . A few hours would be\n",
      "enough, I think.”\n",
      "“Enough for what?”\n",
      "“I have something I need to take care of .”\n",
      "“Jack, I can’t clear those time slots.”\n",
      "“Why not?”\n",
      "“Did you forget? You have the negotiations with\n",
      "Morrison and Gadd.”\n",
      "“The documents with the necessary changes are ready?”\n",
      "“An associate is on it, and it’ll be done in time for the\n",
      "meeting.” “Get them from him.”\n",
      "“But—”\n",
      "“I’ll get it done quicker . Get it for me.”\n",
      "“Done.”\n",
      "“Good, and push the negotiations to two. The other side,\n",
      "Gadd, didn’t want to meet up that early anyway , so let them\n",
      "know ﬁrst.” I got up and moved to sit behind my desk.\n",
      "“And Morrison? What am I supposed to tell him?” she\n",
      "asked.\n",
      "I sighed and ran my ﬁngers through my hair. “Did you\n",
      "read his email? The one he sent this morning?”\n",
      "She nodded.\n",
      "“Well, tell him we need to do more research on the new\n",
      "company he wants to invest twenty million in. I want to get\n",
      "both the negotiations and the new investment deal taken\n",
      "care of today . He won’t mind the delay if we have\n",
      "everything ready .”\n",
      "“Okay . What about the rest of your schedule? We’ll need\n",
      "to push everything back . You have a ﬁve PM call with\n",
      "Gilbert—you can’t miss that today .”\n",
      "“Fine. I’ll leave the oﬀice at eleven. I can get through my\n",
      "ten-thirty call by then, and I’ll come back around one-thirty\n",
      "for the meet ing so push it to then instead. That way I’ll be\n",
      "done with Morrison and Gadd by the time I need to be on\n",
      "the phone with Gilbert. If everything goes as planned, we’ll\n",
      "have Gadd sign the ﬁnal papers at the end of the meeting\n",
      "and I’ll be ready for the call with Gilbert. I’ll stay late and\n",
      "catch up, don’t worry .”\n",
      "“Okay , I can work with that. Where did you say you were\n",
      "going again?”\n",
      "“I didn’t say. Close the door, please, and don’t forget to\n",
      "bring me those documents.”\n",
      "When I lifted my head up from my laptop, Cynthia was\n",
      "already gone.\n",
      "An hour later, when I was going through the documents,\n",
      "making sure everything was ready for the meeting, Samantha appeared at my door. I glanced at Cynthia’s\n",
      "desk, but she was nowhere to be seen.\n",
      "Wanting to get it over with, I was the one who engaged\n",
      "her. “What do you want, Samantha? I need to go over these\n",
      "before I leave.”\n",
      "She shrugged and took my question as an invitation to\n",
      "walk in and sit across from me. “Something is not right\n",
      "with you—or maybe I should say something has changed.”\n",
      "“What the hell are you talking about?”\n",
      "“You’ve been leaving early .”\n",
      "“And that’s your business because…?”\n",
      "“You’re the last one to leave here, every day .”\n",
      "“And now I’m not.” I put down the papers in my hands.\n",
      "“What do you want?”\n",

      "observations.”\n",
      "“What gave you the impression that I would be\n",
      "interested in your observations? I’m not going to explain\n",
      "myself to you. Do you need something from me?”\n",
      "“Not really. I had a little free time so I’m just chatting\n",
      "with you. How is your lovely wife?”\n",
      "If it had been someone else sitting across from me, they\n",
      "would’ve tucked their tail between their legs and left\n",
      "already , but Samantha wasn’t like other people. She had\n",

      "to change that.\n",
      "“If you pull the same shit you pulled at dinner again,\n",

      "released a long sigh, turned around, and gave Cynthia a\n",
      "smile before walking out of my oﬀice.\n",
      "“You need anything?” Cynthia asked, and I shook my\n",

      "assistant in the entire ﬁrm.\n",
      "Done with the papers, I got on with my ten-thirty call,\n",
      "and we wrapped up at a quarter past eleven. Rising, I put\n",
      "on my suit jacket and called Raymond so he could bring the\n",
      "car around front.\n",
      "Leaving the oﬀice, I stopped in front of Cynthia’s desk\n",
      "and dropped oﬀ the documents. “Can you have the copies\n",
      "ready by the time I get back?”\n",
      "“Of course.”\n",
      "“Also, do you remember the charity thing you mentioned\n",
      "a few weeks ago? Something for kids?” I tried to remember\n",
      "where it was going to be held, but I couldn’t come up with\n",
      "the name. “It was on the tenth, I think. I’m not sure.”\n",
      "“Yes, I remember . What about it?”\n",
      "“I want to donate, so I’m going to attend with my wife.\n",
      "Can you take care of everything?”\n",
      "“You’re going  to attend a charity dinner?” Her voice got\n",
      "thinner with each word as her brows rose higher . “Try not to look so surprised. Can you handle it?”\n",
      "She shook herself out of her disbelief . “Of course I can.\n",
      "I’ll give you the info you need when you get back.”\n",
      "“Okay . Thank you, Cynthia. I’ll see you later .”\n",
      "I managed to take a few steps away from her desk\n",
      "before her voice stopped me.\n",
      "“Jack?”\n",
      "I turned back and waited . She played with her glasses\n",
      "and looked away from me.\n",
      "“I’m going to be late. What do you want?”\n",
      "“Jack…it’s not my place, and I know that, so don’t bite\n",
      "my head oﬀ for saying this, but…” I knew nothing that\n",
      "started with those words could be something I’d want to\n",
      "hear.\n",
      "“I don’t bite your head oﬀ .”\n",
      "She smiled, relaxing in her seat. “Only every day .”\n",
      "“Surely not every day,” I said seriously , but her smile\n",
      "grew , and then she slowly went back to being serious.\n",
      "“You have to tell her , Jack.”\n",
      "“I have to tell who what? Samantha?”\n",
      "She pinned me with her stare. “No. Not Samantha. I’ve\n",

      "You have to tell her. That’s all I’m going to say on the\n",
      "matter .”\n",
      "I opened my mouth, but she lifted her ﬁnger and\n",
      "stopped me. “ You have to tell her .”\n",
      "It ﬁnally dawned on me what the hell she was talking\n",
      "about. Of course she was talking about Rose. If there was\n",
      "one person whose crap I’d tolerate, it was Cynthia, and\n",
      "even with her, I had a limit, yet I didn’t respond the way I\n",
      "would’ve responded if it was anyone but her. “It’s not the\n",
      "right time,” I forced out through my gritted teeth.\n",
      "“It’s never going to be the right time, Jack.”\n",
      "As if I didn’t already know  that. As if I didn’t know I was\n",
      "doomed.\n",
      "I left before she could say anything else. NOT EXACTLY  SURE what I would face—because it always\n",
      "seemed to be a surprise  when it came to Rose— I walked\n",
      "through the door. The day before, it had smelled like\n",
      "vanilla; it now smelled of cinnamon and fragrant coﬀee.\n",
      "With the bell’s noise, Rose glanced my way while still\n",
      "attending to a customer . Her smile faltered, but she didn’t\n",
      "lose it compl etely. Instea d of heading over to her, I picked\n",
      "the table next to her little library and got comfortable. My\n",
      "seat was facing her, so I looked around and noticed, out of\n",
      "the twelve tables, nine were occupied. For her second day,\n",
      "she was doing amazingly well. Even the bar seats had a\n",
      "couple customers deep in conversation as they looked out\n",
      "on the street, drinking their coﬀees. Two new customers\n",
      "walked in and I settled down to wait. Taking out my phone,\n",
      "I started to catch up on emails.\n",
      "The few times I glanced up to see if she was avoiding me\n",
      "or was simply busy, my eyes lingered on her, causing me to\n",
      "lose my train of thought. She always looked so lively , so\n",
      "vivacious and conﬁdent. In between customers, her eyes\n",
      "slid my way. I held her gaze to see what she’d do, but she\n",
      "managed to act as if I wasn’t even there.\n",
      "Holding back a smile, I waited. A few minutes turned\n",
      "into ten, and then ﬁnally she stood over me, waiting. I\n",
      "raised an eyebrow and lowered my phone.\n",
      "“I was starting to think you were avoiding me.”\n",
      "“I didn’t expect to see you here. Can I get you\n",
      "anything?”\n",
      "“Why are you always so surprised to see me?” I asked,\n",
      "genuinely curious to hear her answer . Her expression\n",
      "didn’t change , which told me she was still annoyed with me\n",
      "—not that I could understand her reasoning. Her leg had\n",
      "been hurt, so I’d helped her, end of story . Why did it matter\n",
      "what other people she’d probably never see again in her life or even remember if she saw them thought? I’d always\n",
      "been under the impression that women found it romantic\n",
      "when guys carried them. Apparently not this one.\n",
      "“I’m not surprised anymore.” She looked over her\n",
      "shoulder when one of the customers let out a loud laugh\n",
      "then turned back to me. “Can I—”\n",
      "“Were you expecting to see me tonight?” I asked, again,\n",
      "just out of curiosity . I leaned forward and put my phone on\n",
      "the table.\n",
      "She licked her lips, looking toward the kitchen. I\n",
      "followed her gaze and saw the girl she had introd uced me\n",
      "to before—Sally , I believed—leaning against the doorframe\n",
      "and talking to someone in the kitchen, most likely the other\n",
      "employee, the guy. My eyes back on Rose, I waite d to hear\n",
      "her reply .\n",
      "“I was. You always come,” she said, shrugging as if it\n",
      "was a given that I’d be there. I supposed it was now .\n",
      "“Will you join me, please?”\n",
      "She eyed the seat across from me but didn’t sit down.\n",
      "“Can I get you anything before I do that? Coﬀee? T ea?”\n",
      "“I wouldn’t say no to coﬀee if you’re the one preparing\n",
      "it.”\n",
      "She looked a little surprised then nodded and walked\n",
      "away , slowly . She wasn’t limping exactly , so she was\n",
      "probably right that it hadn’t been a serious injury , but she\n",
      "wasn’t walking smoothly either . Point being, her ankle was\n",
      "hurting. I still didn’t understand the fuss when I had only\n",
      "tried to help her .\n",
      "Instead of getting back on my phone and ﬁnishing the\n",
      "response I had started, I watched her prepare coﬀee for\n",
      "both of us, discreetly glancing my way every now and then.\n",
      "A few minutes later, she came back with a small  tray and\n",
      "put it on the table before sitting down across from me.\n",
      "Reaching forward, she put one of the mugs in front of me\n",
      "and held on to the other one. Between us sat a plate full of\n",
      "lemon bars. I gave her a questioning look, but she was busy drinking\n",
      "from her mug, her eyes cast downward.\n",
      "“No work today?” she asked into her coﬀee mug.\n",
      "“I need to get back soon.”\n",
      "She nodded and we fell silent.\n",
      "“So, we’re not talking then,” I concluded. “I’m not\n",
      "planning on apologizing for trying to help you, if that’s\n",
      "what you’re waiting for me to do .”\n",
      "“No, you’re not the kind of person who apologizes, are\n",
      "you?” she asked, lifting her big brown eyes up to mine. “Do\n",
      "you ever apologize? F or anything?”\n",
      "“I try not to do anything I’ll end up having to apologize\n",
      "for,” I answered honestly . Try was the operative word here.\n",
      "She sighed and took another long sip of her coﬀee. “I’m\n",
      "not angry at you for helping me. I would’ve preferred to\n",
      "walk on my own, but I’m not gonna stay angry at you for\n",
      "carrying me. I was a little annoyed by your last comment,\n",
      "that’s all. Still, I’m sorry ,” she mumbled.\n",
      "A little amused, I leaned forward, resting my elbows on\n",
      "the table. “Excuse me? I couldn’t hear what you said to\n",
      "your coﬀee.”\n",
      "“I said—” she looked up and met my eyes. “You heard\n",
      "that.”\n",
      "Why did I enjoy provoking her?\n",
      "Why did I enjoy when she snapped back at me?\n",
      "“For what?” I asked, reaching for my own coﬀee.\n",
      "Another long sigh. “For slamming the door in your face\n",
      "and leaving you out there. It was immature, but in my\n",
      "defense you know exactly which buttons to push.”\n",
      "I couldn’t exactly argue with that. “Okay . Now will you\n",
      "tell me which of my comments made you annoyed with\n",
      "me?”\n",
      "“It’s not important.”\n",
      "“It is to me.”\n",
      "We looked at each other for a while. “I said I’m not some  women  and you said, you’re telling\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "Hiding my smile behind the mug, I kept my eyes on her,\n",
      "and she chose to look anywhere but me. She appeared to\n",
      "be both annoyed and surly at the same time, and deﬁant, of\n",
      "course—deﬁnitely not someone who was regretting\n",
      "slamming the door in my face.\n",
      "“I meant that as a compliment, Rose.”\n",
      "Her eyes came back to me.\n",
      "“I…Good. That’s great then. Thank you?”\n",
      "“How’s your ankle?” I asked, letting her oﬀ the hook.\n",
      "“It’s better . It didn’t swell up, but I’m still taking it easy .”\n",
      "At least the stiﬀness in her shoulders had softened a bit.\n",
      "“How are we? Are we good as well?”\n",
      "Her smile was as sweet as it could get.\n",
      "“Yes, Jack.”\n",
      "“You made lemon bars again,” I commented in the hopes\n",
      "of changing the conversation to safer ground when I felt\n",
      "myself drawn to her even more.\n",
      "She shifted in her seat. “Actually , that was why I was\n",
      "coming in early . I prom ised you I’d make more of them\n",
      "yesterday , bring a batch back to the apartment maybe,\n",
      "because I like them too. I thought I’d get them done before\n",
      "opening up.”\n",
      "“You made them for me?”\n",
      "“I promised.” She shrugged and pushed her hands under\n",
      "her legs. “And I thought  it would be a good apology for\n",
      "slamming the door in your face.”\n",
      "I raise d an eyebrow and took another sip of my coﬀee\n",
      "before reaching for one of the bars. Taking a bite, I\n",
      "watched her watching me.\n",
      "Feeling eyes on me, I looked over Rose’s shoulder , saw\n",
      "Sally keeping  an eye on us from her spot with interest, and\n",
      "missed the end of Rose’ s sentence. I doubted we looked\n",
      "like a real couple from where she was standing, let alone a\n",
      "married one. Maybe we should do something to ﬁx that.\n",
      "My focus shifted back to Rose.\n",
      "“So we had our ﬁrst married ﬁght, huh? How do you feel\n",
      "about that?”\n",
      "“The honeym oon stage is over for us, I’m afraid,” I\n",
      "agreed oﬀhandedly .\n",
      "She nodded. “We made quick work of that. I don’t see\n",
      "good things for the future of our marriage.”\n",
      "“You never know . Maybe we’re one of those married\n",
      "couples who ﬁght at the drop of a hat but never get a\n",
      "divorce. Y ou might be stuck with me.”\n",
      "“Oh, that sounds exhau sting, and annoying for other\n",
      "people. Let’s not be like them. Let’s ﬁnd better examples\n",
      "and try to imitate them.”\n",
      "“Like who?”\n",
      "Her gaze slid up to the ceiling as she tried to come up\n",
      "with an example. “Actual ly, I don’t think I know that many\n",
      "married couples. Y ou?”\n",
      "“I’m afraid the ones I know aren’t people I’d like to\n",
      "imitate,” I answered.\n",
      "“Evelyn and Fred?”\n",
      "“They are more like partners than anything else.”\n",
      "“Oh, from the way Fred talked about her that night, I\n",
      "assumed they were in love.”\n",
      "“They do love each other , but I think if they didn’t have a\n",
      "kid, they wouldn’t have much in common other than work.”\n",
      "“Your parents? How about them? Are they still married?\n",
      "Do they have a happy marriage?”\n",
      "After drinking almost half of the coﬀee, I put it down\n",
      "and leaned back. “The last people you’d like to imitate,\n",
      "trust me. Just look at how I turned out.”\n",
      "“I don’t know . I think they did a pretty good job with\n",
      "you. Then how about we don’t imitate anyone and just\n",
      "make our own rules?”\n",
      "“What kind of a couple do you want to be then?” She thought about it some, taking sips of her coﬀee\n",
      "every now and then. “I don’t want to be one of those\n",
      "couples who are in everyone’s face, being all extra touchy .\n",
      "We could be more subtle, you know what I mean?”\n",
      "I nodded and she kept going.\n",
      "“Let me give you a small example, just in case. Let’s say\n",
      "we’re standing and talking to someone—you can hold my\n",
      "hand or have  your arm around my waist, just keep it simple\n",
      "and…maybe a small, intimate kiss. I don’t know , just…\n",
      "simple.”\n",
      "“Any other tips you have for me?” I asked with a raised\n",
      "eyebrow .\n",
      "“It wasn’t a tip, exactly . You asked what kind of couple I\n",
      "wanted us to be, so I’m just saying. I like that kind of\n",
      "couple.”\n",
      "“What else?”\n",
      "“I want to be the kind of couple that has traditions.\n",
      "Like…maybe Mondays are pizza nights. Thursday  is pasta\n",
      "day. That type of thing.”\n",
      "“That’s it?”\n",
      "“Okay , give me a minute. I’m going to Google this and\n",
      "see what we’re working with. Let me get my phone.”\n",
      "Before I could stop her, she got up and ran to the\n",
      "kitchen. Her movements were a little wobbly and she tried\n",
      "to tiptoe on her left foot, but in essence it would be called\n",
      "running. She waved Sally oﬀ when she looked alarmed, and\n",
      "her return was calmer , no running this time.\n",
      "Puﬀing out a breath, she took her seat again and\n",
      "focused on the screen of her phone. “Okay , let me see…\n",
      "okay, there are more formal types like traditional,\n",
      "disengaged, cohesive, pursuer , distant—we won’t be that. I\n",
      "hate those types. Operatic…heated ﬁghting followed by\n",
      "passionate lovemaking.” Her head snapped up and she\n",
      "stole a glance at me then quickly focused back on her\n",
      "phone. “Nop e. Romantic  couple—that doesn’t sound too bad, does it? Okay , let me try to ﬁnd something more\n",
      "informal…”\n",
      "I drained the rest of my coﬀee.\n",
      "“Okay . Showoﬀs…basically PDA—this is what I meant. I\n",
      "don’t like being all extra. Also, I don’t see you as a PDA\n",
      "person,” she mumbled. “Space-giving couple—I guess\n",
      "we’re like that? Why are they married couple…we can’t be\n",
      "this. That is not me. Even if this is fake, I don’t want to be\n",
      "like that. If we’re playing a part, let’s do it right.”\n",
      "“That would be my parents.”\n",

      "I nodded.\n",
      "“Yikes. Okay , what else… what else…honeymoon couple.\n",
      "Dammit, we just fought, so that doesn’t work for us. Next,\n",
      "whining couple—nope. Always together couple…I mean…”\n",
      "She looked at me under her lashes, but neither one of us\n",
      "made a comment. “The rest is crap.” She put her phone\n",

      "“Let’s stick with doing whatever needs to be done at the\n",
      "moment.”\n",
      "“That’s leaving it very open to interpretation.”\n",
      "I ran my hand over my face. “How about just being\n",
      "ourselves and acting natural?”\n",
      "“You’re loads of fun. Being ourselves individually isn’t\n",
      "the problem. How to be ourselves as a couple—that’s the\n",

      "“What? Do you want to practice playing pretend?” She\n",
      "looked at me weirdly but didn’t respond. I changed tactics,\n",
      "because playing pretend wouldn’t be a good idea at all. Not\n",
      "with how things were going. This was fake and temporary .\n",
      "Period. “Am I allowed to ask about your relationship with\n",
      "your ex-ﬁanc é? What kind of a couple were you? Why did\n",
      "you break up?”\n",
      "She looked taken back but at least responded. “Where\n",

      "“Today, it seems I am.”\n",
      "Looking all kinds of uncomfortable, she sighed. “We\n",

      "it would bug me oﬀ, but other than that it was an easy\n",
      "relationship. Looking back at it now maybe it was too easy.\n",
      "And we just… God, I hate this. I was shocked when he\n",
      "ended things . Came out of nowhere, he dumped  me in a\n",
      "text. I couldn’t believe I was so wrong about him. Couldn’t\n",
      "believe he didn’t want to marry me anymore. Calle d him for\n",
      "days, trying to get in touch. Never heard back. Went to his\n",

      "let it drop down.\n",
      "“I lost it there for a few days. Then sadness gave way to\n",
      "anger . I gave myself perm ission to cry and curse him for a\n",
      "week, but anyone who breaks up with me via text is not\n",
      "worth crying for. I stopped crying on day four. I don’t have\n",
      "the luxury of pining after someone who doesn’t want me.\n",
      "He had this way of making me feel less than without me\n",
      "realizing he was doing it. It was weird. I deﬁnitely thought\n",
      "he was the one for me, up until he broke up with me, but\n",
      "when he wasn’t around anymore, the rose-colored glasses\n",
      "came oﬀ pretty quickly . He was really good at getting me to\n",

      "my strong suit. Eventually , after a long discussion and\n",
      "several changed decisions, everyone had given their\n",
      "orders. I ate another of the lemon bars Rose had baked\n",

      "wasn’t mine, but the idea of it…the possibility… I placed\n",

      "ﬁngers around the bill. Surprisingly , she didn’t say a word,\n",

      "Bodies close, but not touching?” I lifted my head up enough\n",
      "so I could meet her eyes and, in a louder voice, said, “Don’t\n",

      "what about what other people think about the money? Sally\n",
      "asked a ton of questions about you after you left. Whose\n",
      "husband would pay for coﬀee at his wife’s coﬀee shop? It was little things like this that were slowly cracking my\n",

      "Jack:  See, we’re doing just ﬁne as a fake married couple.\n",
      "That sounded a lot like what a wife would say to her\n",

      "on you this time. I’d call that progress.\n",
      "Rose:  Yeah, because you came at me like a turtle.\n",
      "I was drinkin g water when her text came in, and reading\n",
      "it started a coughing ﬁt. It lasted long enough that Cynthia\n",

      "Jack:  I’ll try to work on it.\n",
      "Rose:  There should be a middle ground, I think, but it was\n",
      "a good start. Deﬁnitely closer to the type of couple I’d want\n",
      "to be if I were really married.\n",
      "Jack:  Right. Hopefully I didn’t embarrass you too much.\n",
      "Rose:  No, it was ﬁne. They all thought it was very\n",

      "myself .\n",
      "Rose:  I mean, there is nothing wrong with it, I guess. It’s\n",
      "just a little weird sometimes. Why not kiss me on the lips\n",

      "Rose:  Like I said, I don’t know what to say to you\n",
      "sometimes. Jack:  I think you’re doing just ﬁne considering the number\n",

      "“I’m hanging up then.”\n",
      "“Why? No . Stay on the line—I’ll be right back.”\n",

      "about was how I could dig myself out of this grave I’d\n",
      "ended up in. When the time came, I left for the meeting.\n",
      "Thankfully , everything else was ready , so after doing a\n",
      "quick check on the documents just to conﬁrm everything\n",
      "was in order , I stepped out of my oﬀice.\n",

      "I gritted my teeth, but didn’t answer .\n",
      "“Did you tell her?”\n",

      "wasn’t walking anymore, stopped and backtracked.\n",
      "“You’re going to stop asking me that question,” I forced\n",
      "out, trying my best not to be too rude.\n",
      "“I have so much respect for you, Jack. You know I do.\n",
      "I’ve been working with you for years and I’ve never done\n",
      "this, but right now you need someone to tell you you’re\n",
      "doing wrong. I’m that someone. As foreign as that idea is,\n",
      "you know you’re doing wrong.” “We’re late to the meeting. If you want to—”\n",
      "“No, we’re not. Morrison  called ten minutes ago to say\n",

      "together , you’d know better than to push me on this.”\n",
      "“I care about you, so I’d say I should.”\n",
      "I started walking again, silently passing some of the\n",
      "senior associates as they greeted me. Cynthia kept up with\n",
      "my pace, not uttering another word. I thought she was\n",
      "ﬁnally done, but that changed when no one else was in\n",
      "sight and it was just us again.\n",
      "“Just tell her . It’s not too late.”\n",
      "I came to another abrupt stop. Ready for it this time, she\n",
      "halted next to me, a little out of breath. After glancing\n",
      "behind me, I pulled her into a small junior associate oﬀice\n",
      "and closed the door. Our voices would still carry outside,\n",
      "but at least it would be muﬄed and there would  be some\n",
      "semblance of privacy .\n",
      "“I’m not going to have this same conversation with you\n",
      "again. This is my last warning.”\n",
      "“You telling me not to talk about this again is not us\n",

      "“What the hell has gotten into you today?” I asked,\n",
      "frustrated and not sure how to handle this side of my\n",

      "“I told you: the day you made this ridiculous deal,  I told\n",

      "“Then what’s the problem? Just tell her .”\n",
      "“Tell her what, for fuck’s sake? Tell her I basically\n",

      "damn about the property?”\n",
      "“You didn’t stalk her, Jack. You were trying to help her.\n",
      "She’ll understand when you explain it to her .”\n",
      "“Trying to help by marrying her? There were a number\n",
      "of other things I could’ve  done to help her, Cynthia . Getting\n",
      "married wasn ’t at the top of the list—it shouldn’t have been\n",
      "on the list at all. I was being a selﬁsh bastard.”\n",
      "“Your own gain—”\n",
      "My voice had risen enough that George, who was just\n",

      "“What’s going on here? I can hear your voices from a\n",
      "mile away . Aren’t you supposed to be at the Morrison and\n",
      "Gadd meeting?”\n",
      "“I’m heading there now,” I gritted through my teeth.\n",

      "so long to introduce yourself?”\n",
      "“I’m only going to tell you one more time, Cynthia: if you\n",
      "ever say another word on this subject, I will ﬁre you on the\n",
      "spot and not even think twice about it. I don’t give a damn\n",
      "whether you’re the best or not.”\n",
      "Without waiting for her to even acknowledge what I had\n",
      "just said, I stormed out of the room and headed straight to\n",
      "the meeting.\n",
      "BY THE  TIME the meeting was over, my head was pounding\n",
      "and I was ready to end the day and leave. It was only ﬁve\n",
      "PM, though, so I was stuck in my oﬀice for a few more\n",
      "hours going through more paperwork. Cynthia was smart enou gh to stay out of my sight the\n",
      "entire time. I took all my frustrations out on work and\n",
      "didn’t even think about anything else for the rest of the day ,\n",
      "which is why when I ended my last phone call and lifted my\n",

      "“What are you doing here?” I snapped, my eyes going\n",
      "from her to Cynthia.\n",

      "Inwardly , I cursed myself for taking the extra ten\n",
      "minutes in bed that morning and deciding to do my makeup\n",
      "at the coﬀee shop. I tore my eyes away from him and got up\n",
      "on one knee. He extended his hand to help me get the rest\n",
      "of the way up. As soon as I reached for his hand  and our\n",
      "skin made contact, we experienced a little zap of electric\n",
      "shock betwe en us. I thought, just to be on the safe side, I\n",

      "with what looked like worry .\n",
      "A little ﬂustered by his closeness and his hypnotizing\n",
      "eye color , I remembered that I should probably let go of his\n",

      "“You two seem to get along well,” he commented\n",
      "casually—perhaps a little too casually .\n",
      "I gave  him a quizzical look before trying to refocus on\n",
      "the coﬀee. “We spend every morning together , so yeah. I\n",
      "mean, we talk. Is that a problem?”\n",
      "“Of course not.” Looking a little uncomfortab le, he\n",
      "shifted on his feet, surprising the hell out of me. “I was just\n",

      "I was not good with seeing blood. I didn’t faint or\n",
      "anything dramatic like that, but I wouldn’t have called\n",
      "myself a fan of it either .\n",
      "“Here,” Jack murmured, and I felt him gently cup the\n",

      "towel into my hand and I curled my ﬁngers around it. His hand holding my head up and my hand grippi ng his\n",
      "shoulder , I held the towe l up to my nose and slowly , with\n",
      "his help, started to straighten myself . Something deﬁnitely\n",
      "did run down my nose, but when I looked down at the\n",
      "paper , I felt like a complete moron.\n",
      "My face ﬂaming and my ears ringing, I loosened my\n",
      "death grip on his incredibly muscled shoulders and turned\n",
      "my back to him, wishing  the ﬂoor would open up and I\n",
      "could just disappear .\n",
      "“What is it?” he asked, his voice coming from right over\n",
      "my shoulder , his breath tickling my neck.\n",
      "Dear God.  I closed my eyes.\n",
      "“Nothing. It’s not bleeding—false alarm,” I croaked and\n",
      "stationed myself back in front of the espresso machine,\n",
      "sniﬄing constantly—beca use something was still coming\n",
      "down—and trying to hide my red face the entire time.\n",
      "“What’s wrong with your voice?”\n",
      "The croak hadn’t been just because of my\n",
      "embarrassment. My throat actually did hurt a little when I\n",
      "swallowed, but I’d thought it was nothing when I ﬁrst woke\n",
      "up. Add my runny nose into the mix, though, and maybe it\n",

      "“That’s not why I asked, Rose.”\n",

      "slightly tilted back to avoid any liquid coming down my nose. “It’s probably the cold weather . I never get sick for\n",

      "ﬁrst came into the kitchen?” I raised my voice so he could\n",
      "hear me, but he was already one step ahead of me because\n",
      "he had gotten even closer and was now standing right\n",
      "behind me.\n",
      "His chest touched my back as he leaned forward and\n",
      "pushed some thing in front of me. One hand holding the\n",

      "“What’s that?”\n",
      "“My credit card.”\n",
      "“I can see that. What is it for?” When the steamin g was\n",
      "done, I swirled it for a bit so the bubbles would settle\n",
      "down. Pourin g the espresso into the travel cups, I followed\n",
      "it with the steamed milk. Securing their tops, I faced Jack,\n",
      "waiting for his answer .\n",
      "“The event is going to be a big to-do, so I’d like you to\n",
      "buy something appropriate for the evening.”\n",
      "It was him saying things like this with that unreadable\n",
      "expression of his that made me not like him sometimes.\n",
      "“Did I do a bad job last time? At the dinner with your\n",
      "partners?” I asked, avoiding his gaze.\n",
      "“No. Stop putting words into my mouth.”\n",
      "“Then what is this?” I pushed the credit card back\n",
      "toward him.\n",
      "His forehead creased, and since I’d dropped my gaze\n",
      "from his eyes, I watched a muscle in his jaw twitch . “So you\n",
      "can buy a dress for an event you’re going to attend  because\n",
      "of me. You don’t need to spend your own money . Save it for\n",
      "the rent you’re eventually  gonna be paying me.” He pushed\n",

      "“I can buy my own dress and pay rent, Jack.”\n",
      "“I didn’t say you couldn’t,  Rose, but I’m saying I’d like to\n",
      "buy this one.” It was the fact that I couldn’t argue further that got to\n",
      "me the most, I thought, that I really couldn’t aﬀord to buy a\n",
      "dress that would be appropriate for someone who would be\n",
      "on his arm for a big chari ty event. We were worlds apart. If\n",
      "we had met under diﬀerent circumstances, we would have\n",
      "had nothing in common. A ‘we’ wouldn’t have been a\n",
      "possibility . So…we really were playing pretend, and I had to\n",
      "get that into my head whenever I was looking into his eyes\n",
      "and starting to catch feelings.\n",
      "No more feeling mushy when he came to the coﬀe e shop\n",
      "—which happened often.\n",
      "No more jumpy heart whenever he walked through the\n",

      "Logically , he was right. I wouldn’t be going to such a\n",

      "“Okay , Jack.”\n",
      "Without another word, I picked up the credit card.\n",

      "trying to come up with an answer that would let me get out\n",

      "my chin up and my surprised eyes met his. His thumb\n",

      "mere moments ago that it wasn’t allowed to do that—and\n",
      "then slowly started to pick up speed as I realized I couldn’t look away from his searching eyes. My lips parted because\n",

      "me so intently , as if we weren’t as fake as it got. I wanted to\n",

      "His expression softened, the creases on his forehead\n",
      "smoothing out.\n",
      "“Buy whatever you want, for me.”\n",
      "For him? I nodded, incapable of stringing two words\n",
      "together . His gaze moved across my face, pausing on my\n",
      "lips, and I simply forgot how to breathe. What was he\n",
      "doing? What witchery was this?\n",
      "First you breathe out and then in. No, you need to\n",

      "toward me. He was only a tad quicker than a turtle this\n",

      "nothing that made me jump out of his arms in panic, but\n",
      "even a simple kiss on my cheek as a hello or a hand at the\n",

      "almost every  night we ate takeout in the dining room where\n",
      "he actually made a big eﬀort to talk to me, and I enjoyed\n",
      "every minute of it, but if I said I wasn’t confused, it’d be a lie. That didn’t change anything; even when he received\n",

      "my favorite part of the dress was the ﬁtted bodice that gave\n",

      "added a bit of concealer to what I already had on. I pressed\n",
      "brown eyeshadow onto my eyelids with my ﬁngers then\n",
      "added more blush, and ﬁnally I swiped on a burgundy-\n",
      "colored lipstick, again with my ﬁnger . Standing in front of\n",
      "the elegant full-length mirror, I put the dress on and found\n",
      "myself staring at the reﬂection.\n",
      "To be fair, I didn’t look so bad, but I felt uncomfo rtable,\n",
      "like I was in way too far over my head. A deal was a deal,\n",
      "though, so, trying not to overthink it too much, I bundled\n",
      "myself in my dark grey knee-length coat and ﬂew out of my\n",
      "room. High heels weren’t  my best friend, so I ran barefoot\n",
      "down the stairs and put on the only pair of heels I owned in\n",
      "the foyer .\n",
      "I found Jack right in the middle of the living room,\n",
      "staring down  at his phon e. I didn’t make a sound  as I took\n",
      "him in. His stubble was in great shape as always and\n",
      "demanded your attention when you ﬁrst set eyes on him,\n",
      "but add a tux to the mix and Jack Hawthorne had become\n",
      "deadly . I swallowed down my groan and cleared my throat.\n",
      "My husband glanced up and met my gaze.\n",
      "I didn’t give him a chan ce to comment. “Yes, I know\n",
      "we’re late and I’m sorry , but I’m ready now , we can leave.”\n",
      "He gave me a sharp nod, eyes moving up and down as\n",
      "he put his phone up to his ear. “Raymond, we’ll be there in\n",
      "a minute.”\n",
      "My coat was all buttoned up and I had my hands in my\n",
      "pockets, so the only thing he could see was a few inches of\n",
      "the hem of my embellished skirt. He made no comments as\n",
      "he joined me. Trying to avoid his gaze, I walked ahead of\n",
      "him, and we took the elevator down.\n",
      "“Good evenin g, Steve,” I said as we passed the doorman\n",
      "and my now friend. He winked at me and, as nervous as I was, I couldn’t\n",
      "hold back my smile. “Have a fun night out, Mrs.\n",
      "Hawthorne.” He always called me Mrs. Hawthorne\n",
      "whenever Jack was around, but in the mornings when it\n",
      "was just me and him chatting for a minute or two as I\n",
      "waited for Ray to pull up, I was always Rose. Jack’s hand\n",
      "found my back and I straightened.\n",
      "“Have a good night, Steve,” Jack added, and my\n",
      "surprised gaze ﬂew up to him. Since when had he started\n",
      "talking to Steve? Evide ntly it was a fairly new thing\n",
      "because for a moment there, Steve didn’t know what to say .\n",
      "“Ah…you too, sir .”\n",
      "Then we were out in the cold evening air, the rain now\n",
      "only a drizzle. I was very conscious of Jack’s hand on my\n",
      "back up until I got in the car and scooted all the way to the\n",
      "other end. Nothing chang ed once he got in after me. I was\n",
      "still very aware of his presence, his scent, his eyes whether\n",
      "he was touching me or not.\n",
      "“Hello again, R aymond.”\n",
      "He looked over his shou lder to oﬀer me a smile . “You\n",

      "I blushed and, out of the corner of my eye, notice d Jack\n",
      "tense.\n",
      "“We’re already late as it is. Let’s go,” he ordered in a\n",
      "harsh tone, cutting me oﬀ before I could respond to\n",
      "Raymond.\n",
      "I would’ve apologized again for making us late, but he\n",
      "was being a jerk to Raymond so I chose not to say anything\n",
      "during the entire car ride to where the event was being\n",
      "held downtown. It took us an hour to get there, and being\n",
      "quiet in a car for an entire hour required some serious\n",
      "patience on my part.\n",
      "Exiting the car, we stood side by side at the bottom of\n",
      "the stairs leading up to the brightly lit building.\n",
      "“Why do you sound weird?” Jack asked into the silence. “You and your compliments. Always sweeping me oﬀ my\n",
      "feet.” I said, distracted, my eyes still on the building.\n",
      "“I’m being serious, Rose.”\n",
      "Surprised at the tight tone of his voice, I peered  up at\n",
      "him. “ What?”\n",
      "“Your voice sounds diﬀerent. Is the cold getting worse?”\n",
      "“Oh.” I touched the side of my nose and looked forward\n",
      "again, a little embarrassed that he’d noticed. “The cold,\n",
      "yes. It’s not that much worse, actually , but I do have a small\n",
      "cotton ball in my nose. I thought it would be a better idea\n",
      "than sniﬄing the entire time.”\n",
      "“You need to see a doctor .”\n",
      "“I will.”\n",
      "“Ready?” Jack asked, holding his hand out in between\n",
      "us.\n",
      "I stare d at it for a few seconds and then, left with no\n",
      "other choice, had to put my hand in his very big one. I took\n",
      "a deep breath and took a step forward only to be tugged\n",
      "back gently . When he shifted our hands and linked our\n",
      "ﬁngers toget her, causing my wedding ring to shift slightly , I\n",
      "had to close my eyes for a second and ignore the heavy\n",
      "thump in my chest. Every single time he touched my\n",
      "wedding ring, my heart did a happy little jump.\n",
      "We were ready to go, but neither of us was taking the\n",
      "ﬁrst step. Our hands gripping each other , we stood\n",
      "motionless.\n",
      "“What is it, Rose?” he asked softly , and I closed my eyes\n",
      "tighter this time. He was standing too close, smelling too\n",
      "good, and being nice again.\n",
      "I couldn’t think of a legitimate lie, so instead of just\n",
      "straight-up admitting that simply his presence was\n",
      "aﬀecting me, I blurted out the ﬁrst thing that came to my\n",
      "mind. A t least I was telling the truth.\n",
      "“I don’t like it when you act like a jerk.”\n",
      "When I said the words out loud, I wasn’t looking at him.\n",
      "As a couple passed us, climbing the stairs and, from the looks of it, arguing with each other , I had to wait for Jack’s\n",
      "answer since  I had no intentions of meeting his gaze to see\n",
      "what he was thinking.\n",
      "He only spoke up when the couple’s voices had trailed\n",
      "oﬀ and we couldn’t be heard either .\n",
      "“When was I being a jerk?”\n",
      "That had me looking back at him. “You can’t be that\n",
      "unaware of it. Y ou were a complete jerk to R aymond, Jack.”\n",
      "“Is that why you didn’t say a single word to me during\n",
      "the ride?”\n",
      "Perplexed, I just peered at him. “You snapped at him for\n",
      "no reason.”\n",
      "“He complimented my wife,” he argued. “We didn’t have\n",
      "time to sit around and chitchat for an hour .”\n",
      "“Your fake wife, and he knows that.”\n",
      "Fascinated, I stared as the muscle started ticking  in his\n",
      "jaw.\n",
      "“Is that supposed to help your case? I do—”\n",
      "“He just said one sentence as he was starting the car.” I\n",
      "lifted one ﬁnger up to make my point. “He was being nice,\n",
      "and he is my friend. You’re the one who acted like a jerk. I\n",
      "think it’s expected that I wouldn’t want to talk to you.”\n",
      "“Great,” he bit out.\n",
      "“Great,” I shot back, terser .\n",
      "He stared down into my eyes and I stared right back, not\n",
      "backing down. I must’ve imagined the lip twitch, because a\n",
      "second later he barked out another order for us to head\n",
      "inside and we were trotting up the stairs.\n",
      "Still hand in hand.\n",
      "It was a big problem that I didn’t mind holding his hand.\n",
      "The second we stepped through the doors, the soft\n",
      "classical music hit my ears, replacing all the horns and\n",
      "sirens.\n",
      "Here we go .\n",
      "We stopped in front of the coat check as the couple who\n",
      "had just passed us was still lingering in the corner , arguing in hushed tones.\n",
      "“I’m sorry ,” Jack grumbled, stopping right next to me,\n",
      "eyes focused  on the coup le. “It wasn’t my intention to be a\n",
      "jerk. F orgive me?”\n",
      "Shocked at his words and the softness I heard in his\n",
      "voice, my head snapped to him and I took in his proﬁle.\n",
      "God, he was so good looking. I really had no chance, not\n",
      "from the very ﬁrst day .\n",
      "“That’s okay,” I mumbled back still a little surprised at\n",
      "what I felt when I looked  at him, and his hand gave mine a\n",
      "quick squeez e. Just when I was pretty sure it was going to\n",
      "be easier not to like him, he did something like that and left\n",
      "me at a loss for words.\n",
      "“You don’t have a purse?” he asked, leaning into my ear.\n",
      "I had to lean away just a little so I wouldn’t burrow myself\n",
      "against his chest. For that little piece of idiocy , I blamed his\n",
      "breath, which I’d felt on my neck, causing a shiver to move\n",
      "up my spine.\n",
      "He let go of my hand and stood at my back, ready to\n",
      "help me take oﬀ my coat. “I don’t have anything that\n",
      "matches,” I answered softly , angling my head to the left so\n",
      "he could hear me as I slowly started to unbutton my coat\n",
      "with cold ﬁngers and then gently shrugged it oﬀ .\n",
      "“Why didn’t you buy something?”\n",
      "“You said to get a dress, and I don’t need a purse. Don’t\n",
      "worry , the dress alone cost a fortune already .”\n",
      "He handed oﬀ my coat to the girl and when he forgot to\n",
      "say thank you, I spoke for both of us and oﬀere d a small\n",
      "smile. A second later I heard Jack grumble a thank you too\n",
      "as he was taking oﬀ his own coat.\n",
      "It made me smile and I walked ahead.\n",
      "Thankfully , inside the ballroom where the event was\n",
      "being held, it was much warmer , so I didn’t think  I’d have\n",
      "much problem with freezing in my dress. Discreetly , I\n",
      "touched my nose to make sure the little cotton ball I’d\n",
      "pushed in back at the apartment was still there. How fun was it that my runny nose had decided to stick around?\n",
      "Tugging the bell sleeves  of my dress and trying  to make\n",

      "next to me again.\n",
      "When he reappeared at my side, I caught him staring at\n",
      "me. I looked down at myself .\n",
      "“What? Is it too much?”\n",
      "“Rose.”\n",
      "I met his piercing gaze with an arched brow and waited\n",
      "for him to go on, but he just stared. Starting  to feel\n",
      "worried, I tried to pull down the tan lining underneath my\n",
      "dress.\n",
      "“No. No, it isn’t,” he whispered. “You look incredible,”\n",
      "he said, and my eyes snapped up to his.\n",
      "This time when he oﬀered his hand, it was a welcome\n",
      "distraction.\n",
      "“I…you look incredible too, Jack. You always do,” I\n",
      "murmured feeling myself blush a little.\n",
      "He opened his mouth to say something, but right at that\n",
      "moment, an older man put a hand on his shoulder and drew\n",
      "his attention away from me.\n",
      "Jack introduced us, but after the initial shock of hearing\n",
      "Jack had gotten married, the guy wasn’t really interested in\n",
      "me. They started talking about a company I believed Jack\n",
      "was representing. Keeping the ﬁxed smile on my face, I\n",
      "tuned them out, taking the opportunity to look around the\n",
      "room.\n",
      "When I spotted two table s full of kids toward the back of\n",
      "the room, I couldn’t hide my curiosity . Some of them were\n",
      "talking to each other , while some of them just stared\n",
      "around in wonder . Their clothes didn’t ﬁt in with this\n",
      "snazzy crowd, so I doubted they belonged to anyone who\n",

      "sitting with them.\n",
      "As Jack ﬁnished his conversation with the guy, Ken\n",
      "something, I leaned close r to him so nobody could hear us. He leaned down at the same time to make it easie r for me,\n",
      "and my nose got a pretty good whiﬀ of his cologne when\n",
      "my nose bumped his neck. It was the one I hated because it\n",
      "made me go all wonky around him—not a good look. “What\n",
      "charity is this event for?”  I asked, managing to focus after\n",

      "“An organization that supports foster kids.”\n",

      "My entire childhood spent with the Colesons was rough.\n",
      "I was unwan ted. For a kid that age, that knowled ge was a\n",
      "hard pill to swallow . I knew what these kids were going\n",
      "through, how alone they felt, how abandoned and\n",
      "sometimes worthless. I’d always have a soft spot for kids\n",
      "and probably would have for the rest of my life.\n",
      "Steeling my voice, I whispered, “I’d like to donate too.\n",
      "Where can I—”\n",
      "Jack cleared his throat and looked away from me, his\n",
      "eyes moving across the crowd. “I’m already donating.”\n",
      "“I understand that, but I’d like to donate as well.”\n",
      "“I’m donating, so you don’t have to .”\n",
      "He started walking, but this time holding hands worked\n",
      "in my favor and I was the one who tugged him back. He\n",
      "gave me an incredulous  look as I raised my brows and\n",
      "waited for him to give me the answer I was looking for .\n",
      "I didn’t know why he chose to lean down and whisper it\n",
      "in my ear, but I couldn’t  exactly push him away . Before I\n",
      "could stop myself , I was tilting my head to the side and\n",
      "closing my eyes. Savoring the moment.\n",
      "“We’re married, Rose. My donation is in both of our\n",
      "names. Let me do this.”\n",
      "I heard his unspoken words as if he had spoken out loud.\n",
      "For you. Let me do this for you.\n",
      "As he was pulling back, I reached up with my free hand\n",
      "and held on to his neck so he would stay put and listen.\n",
      "“Married or not, that’s your money , Jack. I love that you’re\n",
      "doing it in both our names, that means the world, but I\n",
      "want to help, too . We can both donate.”\n",
      "For a long moment there  was no answer , but he stayed\n",
      "bent like that, looking into my eyes. After a few more\n",
      "seconds passed in silence, feeling awkward I started to\n",
      "drop my hand from his neck, but he captured my wrist with\n",
      "his left one before I could and kept it on his shoulder .\n",
      "I swallowed as I realized we were basically standing in\n",
      "an embrace in front of everyone, though it didn’t matter\n",
      "much to me whether anyone was watching or not. When I\n",
      "felt Jack’s nose brush my neck, my ﬁngers tightened on his\n",
      "shoulder and a small shiver went through my body. I\n",
      "smiled.\n",
      "“Does everyt hing have to be a battle between us? Do\n",
      "you despise me that much? I’m taking care of it, Rose.\n",
      "Trust me. I’ll be donating one hundred and ﬁfty thousand\n",
      "dollars in both our names.”\n",
      "He ﬁnally pulled back and peered into my eyes. Like a\n",
      "ﬁsh, I opened  and closed my eyes. Despise him? What gave\n",
      "him that idea?\n",
      "“I could never despise you, Jack,” I whispered, feeling\n",
      "out of my depth.\n",
      "Satisﬁed, he nodded once. “Let’s ﬁnd our table.”\n",
      "I closed my eyes for a quick second, trusting him to\n",
      "steer me away from any obstacles, and let out a deep\n",
      "breath. For the time being, playing the role of husband and\n",
      "wife was going to play some real tricks with my mind, and I\n",
      "wasn’t sure if I was gonna handle it all that well come the\n",
      "end of the night.\n",
      "I opened my eyes and noticed we were passing the kids’\n",
      "table. One of the little girls—she couldn’t have been over\n",
      "eight—was looking up at us with wide eyes, so I winked at her and watched her quickly drop her gaze back to her lap\n",
      "as she played with the edge of the white tablecloth.\n",
      "When I faced forward again and Jack came to a halt, I\n",
      "still had a smile on my face. Maybe tonigh t won’t be so bad\n",
      "after all, I thought, but then when I saw who was standing\n",
      "in front of us, I wasn’t so sure about that anymore.\n",
      "Bryan smiled  at us, not a happy smile like you’d expect\n",
      "from someone you’d considered family for long years, but a\n",
      "mocking one.\n",
      "“What a great coincidence to run into you two here!”\n",
      "Bryan exclaimed, looking from me to Jack. “Oh, this is a\n",
      "good night indeed.”\n",
      "“Bryan,” Jack returned tightly .\n",
      "I could n’t say anything because I could see the couple\n",
      "standing right behind him, talking to an older woman. I was\n",
      "paralyzed.\n",
      "As Bryan leaned forward  to press a kiss on my cheek,\n",
      "Jack pulled me slightly against him so my shou lder was\n",
      "leaning again st his side. I didn’t react. I was shocked into\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "“Congratulations on your marriage again. I know we\n",
      "started on the wrong foot, but we can’t let little things like\n",
      "that get in the way of family, right Jack?” he asked. Bryan’s\n",
      "fake smile slid oﬀ his face when neither Jack nor I\n",
      "responded, and he followed my gaze and looked  over his\n",
      "shoulder . “Jodi, look who I found here.”\n",
      "Jodi turned to face her brother and her…companion\n",
      "turned with her .\n",
      "I felt the remaining blood drain from my face, and as\n",
      "they strolled toward us, Jack’s hand tightened around mine.\n",
      "I was thankful that I was leaning against him because\n",
      "otherwise I didn’t think I could’ve stayed uprigh t for too\n",
      "long.\n",
      "Jodi and my ex-ﬁancé, Joshua, who had his hand around\n",
      "her waist, stopped in our little circle and greeted us as if\n",
      "nothing was wrong. It was the ﬁrst time I was seeing him after he had broken up with me via text. It felt like it’d been\n",
      "ages, and now he was at a charity event with Jodi.\n",
      "Even though I had no feelings left for my ex-ﬁancé\n",
      "anymore, I felt my heart break into little pieces all the\n",
      "same. Jodi smiled at me as if this was all normal and\n",
      "congratulated me on my marriage and apologized on\n",
      "missing the opening of my coﬀee shop, just like Bryan had.\n",
      "It seem ed just as fake and forced. I couldn’t even nod in\n",
      "return because I couldn’t take my eyes oﬀ of Joshua. He\n",
      "spared me one glance and then looked anywhere but me.\n",
      "I think Jack and Bryan exchanged a few more words, I\n",
      "could hear Jack’s clipped  and anything-but-happy tone, but\n",
      "the pounding  in my ears prevented me from making out\n",
      "speciﬁc words. Starting to feel a little dizzy , I took my\n",
      "shocked eyes oﬀ of Joshua when Jodi leaned up and\n",
      "whispered something in his ear, earning a low chuckle from\n",
      "him. I’d been on the receiving end of that chuckle before,\n",
      "and I had loved the warm sound. Now it made my stomach\n",
      "turn.\n",
      "I leane d harder on Jack, thankful that he was so big and\n",
      "strong next to me. He moved our joined hands from\n",
      "between our bodies and rounded his arm around my waist,\n",
      "my hand still very much attached to his, my arm bent.\n",
      "I didn’ t exactly know what to do with myself , so when I\n",
      "felt Jack’s warm lips against my temple, I looked up at him\n",
      "with a dazed look.\n",
      "“You want to go ﬁnd our table?”\n",
      "I studied his face, his beautiful but angry eyes. He\n",
      "looked so good in a tux, so unattainable, yet there  he was,\n",
      "not mine but still holding me up.\n",
      "“Yes,” I whispered. “Please.”\n",
      "Jack bid good evening to my cousins and Joshua, and I\n",
      "managed to force a faint smile on my lips. Jodi and Joshua\n",
      "were already walking away .\n",
      "“Looking forward to hearing back from you, Jack,” Bryan\n",
      "said and touched my arm which made me instinctively jerk and then he walked away too . I couldn’t even make sense of\n",
      "his words.\n",
      "“What’s he talking about, Jack.”\n",
      "“Don’t worry about it. Would you like to leave?” Jack\n",
      "asked, and I turned my unfocused eyes back to him.\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "My husband, the strong man who was still holding me\n",
      "up, started to gently turn me toward the door we had just\n",
      "come in through. Two steps later, I put my hand on his arm\n",
      "and stopped him.\n",
      "“No. No, wait. We made a deal. I’m sorry . I’m not going\n",
      "to leave.”\n",
      "I was talking to his chest, but he nudged my chin up and\n",
      "looked deep into my soul.\n",
      "“There is no deal, Rose.”\n",
      "“Yes, there is. This is a business deal. There is no reason\n",
      "for us to leave.”\n",
      "“Rose—” he started, but I cut him oﬀ .\n",
      "“That was Joshua, my ex -ﬁancé, with my cousin.”\n",
      "His lips tightened. “I know who he is.”\n",
      "“I was surprised, that’s all. I’m okay now .”\n",
      "“I didn’t know ,” he ground out after a few seconds of\n",
      "searching for something in my eyes. God, his eyes were\n",
      "beautiful. “If I had known they’d be here, your cousins\n",
      "and… I didn’t know , Rose.”\n",
      "I smiled, just a little. “I know that.”\n",
      "“What was wrong with Bryan? He called me just a few\n",
      "days ago, still threatenin g. Why would he talk like he just\n",
      "did?”\n",
      "“You didn’t tell me he called.”\n",
      "“It wasn’t important.”\n",
      "“It is. If he bothers you again, tell me.”\n",
      "I nodded.\n",
      "“Rose… I thought you’d enjoy this one, the cause—that’s\n",
      "why I chose it.” My smile widened and resembled something more\n",
      "genuine. “You’re right. I will enjoy this one because of the\n",
      "cause.”\n",
      "He shook his head, his expression hard. “I’m messing\n",
      "this up every step of the way , aren’t I?”\n",
      "I wasn ’t sure what came over me, but something in his\n",
      "tone didn’t sit well. So, as if it was the most natural thing\n",
      "for me to do, still lookin g into his eyes, I rose up on my\n",
      "tippy toes, placed my hand on his stubbled cheek, and\n",
      "kissed the edge of his lips. That was as far as I’d allow\n",
      "myself to go. His hand tightened on my waist, pulling me at\n",
      "least a few inches closer to him. It didn’t close the gap\n",
      "between us, but I was aware of his hand and where it was\n",
      "the entire time.\n",
      "“Thank you,” I whispered as I dropped down to my\n",
      "heels, busying myself with ﬁxing his bow tie.\n",
      "He let go of my waist. “F or what?”\n",
      "I didn’t have a straight answer for that. “Just thank\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "He ground his perfectly square jaw and sighed. “You\n",
      "sure you want to stay?”\n",
      "I wasn ’t sure, but I wasn’t going to leave. I wouldn’t give\n",
      "them the satisfaction, no matter how much I wante d to tuck\n",
      "my tail between my legs and ﬂee. “ Yes. Completely .”\n",
      "As we broke out of our little private bubble, I started to\n",
      "hear everything else around us: a man’s robust laughter ,\n",
      "plates clinking, someone coughing, a woman’s giggle, and\n",
      "the low classical music. Jack guided us as he always did,\n",
      "with a gentle hand on my back, and I made sure not to look\n",
      "anywhere but forward. It was very hard not to ﬂinch at\n",
      "every loud noise as we walked around tables and ﬁnally\n",
      "came to a stop in front of one that was tucked at the very\n",
      "edge.\n",
      "Jack pulled out a chair and I sat down. Obviously , I\n",
      "didn’t know anyone at the table, but I didn’t think Jack did\n",
      "either . For a long while, we were quiet. Then I made the mistake of looking to my right, just to see if I could see the\n",
      "kids from where I was sitting, but my eyes met with\n",
      "Joshua’s instead. They were two tables to our right and a\n",
      "little behind.  It didn’t look like Jodi was with him at that\n",
      "moment, but Bryan was there, sitting to his right, talking to\n",
      "someone else who was seated at their table. Joshua didn’t\n",
      "break eye contact with me, his brown eyes watching,\n",
      "calculating. Then, so subtly I almost missed it, he raised his\n",
      "champagne as if toasting me.\n",
      "I turned back around, feeling sick to my stomach and\n",
      "promising myself I wouldn’t look over my shoulder again\n",
      "during the entire event.\n",
      "“How do you feel?” Jack asked, and my eyes slid to him.\n",
      "He was staring ahead, his jaw ticking again.\n",
      "In a way, I knew he wasn’t asking how I felt about the\n",
      "situation. I believed he was asking what I was feeling\n",
      "toward my ex -ﬁancé.\n",
      "I answ ered honestly in a steady voice. “Sick to my\n",
      "stomach.” That was exactly how I felt, though somehow I\n",
      "also felt relieved that I hadn’t made the mistake of\n",
      "marrying someone like Joshua—someone who told me how\n",
      "much he loved me so easily and so often and yet, in the\n",
      "end, apparently didn’t mean it at all. I couldn’t even begin\n",
      "to comprehend how he could be with Jodi. They knew each\n",
      "other through me. We’d had dinner together a handful of\n",
      "times with the family when Gary had invited him over and\n",
      "they’d chatted every now and then when we bumped into\n",
      "each other, but I could’ve never , ever imagined… this—not\n",
      "even from Jodi, and deﬁnitely not from Joshua. He’d always\n",
      "told me he thought Jodi was like an ice princes s and he\n",
      "didn’t care for that type.\n",
      "My hands were in my lap, almost frozen, so when Jack’s\n",
      "hand covered mine, I dropped my eyes, watching him\n",
      "slowly link our ﬁngers together again, just as he had done\n",
      "so many times in the last hour. I was fascinated by it\n",
      "enough that I let go of every single thought about Jodi and Joshua evidently being together and focused on the only\n",
      "thing that was warming me from the inside out.\n",
      "“Your hands are cold,” Jack muttered under his breath,\n",
      "and I realized how close we were sitting to each other .\n",
      "Had he moved? He kept our hands on my thigh, mine\n",
      "tightly grasp ed in his, and I decided I liked the feel of it,\n",
      "the heaviness, the warm th. So I held on just as tight. “I\n",
      "know .”\n",
      "His thumb started rolling my wedding ring around my\n",
      "ﬁnger .\n",
      "Back and forth.\n",
      "Back and forth.\n",
      "It was such a weird sensation, feeling his skin on mine.\n",
      "Did he feel the same? The tingles?\n",
      "He nodded once and I peered at him under my lashes,\n",
      "trying not to be too obvious. So what if he was just\n",
      "pretending? I could do the same. I could take this comfort\n",
      "from him and let myself feel loved. I could just stop\n",
      "thinking and enjoy my seconds and minutes with him. I\n",
      "didn’t have to analyze my every move. I could  just be\n",
      "whatever I wanted to be with Jack while we were out in\n",
      "public like this. I could fool myself , happily , before we had\n",
      "to step back into the real, harsh world.\n",
      "Lifting my head, I looked at him. Two spots were open at\n",
      "our table to Jack’s left, the other four seats taken by two\n",
      "women and two men who were talking among themselves.\n",
      "“Jack, talk to me,” I urged as the emcee of the night took\n",
      "the stage and the lights dimmed just slightly . A hush fell\n",
      "over the crowd in the room, but there was still quiet\n",
      "chatter here and there, which was why I didn’t feel guilty\n",
      "about my lack of attention.\n",
      "Jack’s eyes were on the stage, but they turned to me and\n",
      "I repeated my words.\n",
      "“Just talk to me.”\n",
      "He sighed. “ What do you want to talk about?” I shrugged, glad he didn’t put up much of a ﬁght.\n",
      "“Anything. Everything. Whatever you want.”\n",
      "A line etched  between his brows as he studied me for a\n",
      "quick mome nt. “How many cups of coﬀee did you sell\n",
      "today? Y ou didn’t text.”\n",
      "I smiled, my heart settlin g down a bit more. As much as\n",
      "he insisted he wasn’t good at small talk, I always enjoyed\n",
      "his company. He had his own way of doing things. He rarely\n",
      "lost the frown, for one thing, but in my eyes, it only made\n",
      "him look more attractive . He could frown at me an entire\n",
      "night and I still wouldn’t mind it. I relaxed in my seat,\n",
      "ﬁnally starting to thaw out.\n",
      "“One hundred eighty-six.”\n",
      "“That’s a few more than yesterday , isn’t it?”\n",
      "I nodded.\n",
      "“Are you happy then?” he asked.\n",
      "I gave him a bigger smile. “I am. It’s going to be\n",
      "cinnamon week next week and I’m very excited about that.\n",
      "Do you have a special request? I might be able to make it\n",
      "happen.”\n",
      "His gaze moved away from mine for a brief moment\n",
      "when the entire room erupted in laughter and then\n",
      "applause. I noticed an army of waiters swarming around\n",
      "the tables, two of them rounding ours with plates in their\n",
      "hands. Jack let go of my hand and leaned back so the\n",
      "waiter could  do his job. The loss of his touch settled over\n",
      "me, and I wasn’t sure how I was supposed to feel about\n",
      "that. They took our drink orders: white wine for me and\n",
      "whiskey on the rocks for Jack.\n",
      "As soon as they left us alone with our weirdly colored\n",
      "risottos and went to get the drink orders, I leaned back in.\n",
      "“Any speciﬁc cinnamon orders?”\n",
      "I would’ve preferred him grabbing my hand again, but\n",
      "instead he casually slung his arm across the back of my\n",
      "chair and turned his body toward me.\n",
      "“Anything you make yourself , save some for me.” “I make this braided cinnamon thing. It’s a Swedish\n",
      "recipe and I love it. I can do that if you want.”\n",
      "“I’d like that,” he said simply, and we had to pull away a\n",
      "little when our drinks arrived. I wasn’t a fan of alcohol and\n",
      "rarely drank,  but it felt like it would be a necessity on this\n",
      "night.\n",
      "I took a sip of my wine, and he took a sip of his whiskey .\n",
      "“Do you know a lot of people here?” I asked, pushi ng my\n",
      "glass away .\n",
      "He looked over his shoulder and his features hardened.\n",
      "Curious, I followed his gaze and saw Joshua staring again,\n",
      "even though Jodi was sitting right next to him. His arm was\n",
      "around her chair , almost exactly like Jack’s had been on\n",
      "mine. I tore my eyes away and put my palm on Jack’s\n",
      "stubbled cheek again. Applying a little pressure, I turned\n",
      "his head back to me.\n",
      "“Jack, do you know a lot of people here?” I repeated as\n",
      "he drained the rest of his whiskey in one go. “It’s just\n",
      "gonna be the two of us tonight, okay? We’re not gonna\n",
      "focus on anyone else. We need to look like a happily\n",
      "married couple so it’s just gonna be the two of us.” It felt as\n",
      "if I repeated enough times maybe I’d believe it myself as\n",
      "well.\n",
      "“A few. I know a few people,” he responded ﬁnally, his\n",
      "voice rough from the alcohol.\n",
      "When the waiter was close enough, he ordered another\n",
      "one. I took a small sip of my own wine and tried a small\n",
      "bite of the risotto . It wasn’t the worst thing I could ’ve been\n",
      "eating. I glanced at the people sitting across from  us and\n",
      "noticed none of them were interested in what was\n",
      "happening on the stage either .\n",
      "When I noticed somethin g drip from my nose onto the\n",
      "tablecloth, my whole face heated, and I quickly reached for\n",
      "the napkin, cursing myse lf for not having a small handbag I\n",
      "could’ve stashed a few things in. Mortiﬁed, I hoped Jack—\n",
      "or anyone else, for that matter—hadn’t seen my runny nose. Trying to be discreet about it, I dabbed the napkin on\n",
      "my upper lip and slightly on my nose. I could already feel\n",
      "my cheeks ﬂushing as I started to panic. I looked down at\n",
      "the napkin and just saw clean liquid saturating the cloth.\n",
      "Pushing my chair back, I got up, and Jack rose with me.\n",
      "I sniﬄed quietly , my hand  going to my nose. Our height\n",
      "diﬀerence worked in my favor since I could keep my head\n",
      "tilted back as I looked up at him. “Just going to the\n",
      "bathroom. Y ou don’t have to come, Jack.”\n",
      "He didn’t listen and followed me all the way to the back\n",
      "of the ballro om. I rushed inside and, thankful that no one\n",
      "else was in there, stood in front of the mirror . Reaching up,\n",
      "I pulled the cotton out of my nose and just stared at it. It\n",
      "was saturated to the point that I could squeeze it and\n",
      "watch it drip. I had no idea what was going on exactly, but I\n",
      "was pretty sure this wasn’t just a runny nose anymore. I\n",
      "must’ve been allergic to something. I already had an\n",
      "appointment with the doctor on Monday so he could give\n",
      "me some nose spray to stop this from happening, but until\n",
      "then I was going to have to be careful about not dripping\n",
      "around other people.\n",
      "When a knock sounded on the door, I opened it halfway\n",
      "and just pushed my head out.\n",
      "“Everything okay in there?” Jack asked, trying to look\n",
      "over my head.\n",
      "“Yes, of course. I’ll be out in a minute.”\n",
      "I didn’ t give him a chance to say anything else and let\n",
      "the door close in his face. After tearing up some toilet\n",
      "paper and rolling it into a shape that I could tampon my\n",
      "nose with, I quickly looked myself over in the mirror and\n",
      "noticed how pale I looked. The burgundy lipsti ck I was\n",
      "wearing stood out too much in contrast to my skin.\n",
      "Grabbing some more toilet paper , I dabbed some of it oﬀ,\n",
      "turning it into just a tint of color . Finally exiting the\n",
      "bathroom, I rejoined Jack. “We can go back,” I muttered as I tried to walk past him,\n",
      "but he stopped me.\n",
      "“What’s wrong?”\n",
      "“Nothing. W e can go .”\n",
      "“Were you crying?”\n",
      "I frowned up at him in confusion. “ Why would I cry?”\n",
      "“Your ex -ﬁancé is here.”\n",
      "“I noticed.”\n",
      "“With your cousin,” he added helpfully .\n",
      "“Really? Where?” I asked in mock outrage.\n",
      "He sighed and ran his hand through his casually styled\n",
      "hair. “We should leave.”\n",
      "“You keep saying that, but we don’t need to .”\n",
      "“Why not? And if you say we made a deal one more time,\n",
      "I’ll carry you out of here over my shoulder .”\n",
      "His unexpected words pulled a laugh out of me. “You\n",
      "could try and see how that goes for you this time around,” I\n",
      "oﬀered with a little grin.\n",
      "He didn’t grin back. “ You sure about this?”\n",
      "“Why should I be the one who leaves? I didn’t do\n",
      "anything wrong, so I’m not going to give them the\n",
      "satisfaction. Stop asking me. I’d like to try to enjoy this\n",
      "night.”\n",
      "“I don’t want you to get hurt, Rose.”\n",
      "I stared up at him. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t fair that he\n",
      "was randoml y saying things like that when I was feeling so\n",
      "oﬀ-kilter around him. “You won’t let me,” I said, choking a\n",
      "little and having trouble ﬁnding the right words. “You won’t\n",
      "let anyone hurt me.” I knew—somehow I knew he wouldn’t\n",
      "let anything hurt me.\n",
      "He released a breath. “ As you wish. Ready to go back?”\n",
      "I nodded then hesitated after a few steps.\n",
      "“I feel like everyone is looking at us, in there.”\n",
      "“That’s because they are.” Jack’s eyes moved on my\n",
      "face, then my body. I felt my cheeks heat up. “Look at you.\n",
      "How could they not.” Oh, geez.\n",
      "While I was trying to come up with something to say he\n",
      "covered my hand with his. A little surprised, I looked down\n",
      "and then up to him, but he was looking straight ahead. As\n",
      "another round of applause broke out in the room, we\n",
      "stepped back  in again. Because of all the waiters rushing\n",
      "around, we were walking  really slowly , and that’s how I felt\n",
      "a small hand on my leg as I was passing a table.\n",
      "“Jack, what a surprise to see you here!” someone said\n",
      "from our left, blocking our way back. As Jack was shaking\n",
      "hands with the man, I glanced back to see a little girl\n",
      "quickly turn her head away when our eyes met.\n",
      "When I tried to pry my hand away from Jack’s, he\n",
      "stopped talking and looked down at me questioningly . “I’ll\n",
      "be right back,” I whispered, smiling at his friend before\n",
      "retracing my steps back to the little girl. She was stealing\n",
      "little glances at me, and the closer I got, the more she\n",
      "couldn’t look away . When I was standing next to her, she\n",
      "looked up at me with these big beautiful blue eyes. It\n",
      "wasn’t as deep as Jack’s blue, but a lighter shade, a\n",
      "sweeter one.\n",
      "I gently dropped down to my knees, holding on to her\n",
      "chair with my hand.\n",
      "“Hi,” I whispered, leaning toward her .\n",
      "She bit her lip and looked at someone I assumed was\n",
      "either a social worker to keep the kids in line or just a\n",
      "chaperone, but the woman was busy listening to whoever\n",
      "was on stage and didn’t notice me and the little girl talking.\n",
      "Both hands on the seat of her chair , the girl leaned\n",
      "closer and whispered, “Hi.”\n",
      "I grinned at her and she gave me a crooked smile.\n",
      "“I love your dress. Is it new?” I asked. She looked down\n",
      "at herself . She wore a simple long-sleeved pink dress. It\n",
      "wasn’t anyth ing special, but its owner was, and that was all\n",
      "that mattered. “They gave it to me today ,” she explained. “It’s pink. It’s\n",
      "mine now , I think.”\n",
      "“It looks gorgeous on you. I wish I had a prett y pink\n",
      "dress like that, too .”\n",
      "“You do?”\n",
      "I nodd ed enthusiastically . “I don’t have such beautiful\n",
      "blonde hair like yours, though, so I’m not sure I would look\n",
      "that good in pink, but I’m jealous just the same.”\n",
      "She gently touched my arm with one single ﬁnger and\n",
      "quickly pulled it back.\n",
      "“My name is Rose. What’s yours?”\n",
      "“Madison, but my friends call me Maddy .”\n",
      "“Nice to meet you, Maddy .” I held out my arm so she\n",
      "would feel free to touch me again. “Do you think my dress\n",
      "looks okay on me? I’m not sure.”\n",
      "“It’s so pretty ,” she whispered longingly , and this time\n",
      "she felt okay enough to run her hand up and down the\n",
      "embellishments on my sleeves. She looked at me and then\n",
      "to the chaperone, and when she saw the woman still hadn’t\n",
      "noticed us, she crooked her ﬁnger at me. I had to take two\n",
      "steps on my knees to get there and then she leaned in even\n",
      "closer , speak ing into my ear. “I’m sorry I touched you. I’m\n",
      "not supposed to touch anyone tonight.”\n",
      "I tried to force a brighter smile on my face. “That’s okay.\n",
      "I won’t tell anyone.”\n",
      "“Okay . Thank you.”\n",
      "The girl sitting on her right, who could only have been a\n",
      "few years older than Maddy , turned to us too .\n",
      "“Hey , what are you doing on the ground?”\n",
      "“Hey yourself ,” I said, smiling. “Just chatting with your\n",
      "friend.”\n",
      "“I like your hair .”\n",
      "“Oh, really? Thank you.”\n",
      "“I love yours. I wish I had curls like that.”\n",
      "She swung her head from  side to side, her tiny, frazzled\n",
      "curls ﬂying everywhere. “I don’t have to do anything to mine.”\n",
      "“You’re so lucky .”\n",
      "“Sometimes other kids make fun of it though.”\n",
      "My heart ached. I’d also had kids make fun of me when I\n",
      "was her age. Kids could be brutal. “Don’t listen to them.\n",
      "Trust me, they’re just jealous.”\n",
      "“What’s your name?” she asked, leaning over the back\n",
      "of her chair .\n",
      "“Rose.”\n",
      "“It’s a pretty name. Y ou’re pretty , too.”\n",
      "My heart melted. “Thank you. You’re so sweet. What’s\n",
      "your name?”\n",
      "“Sierra.”\n",
      "“Really? I had a friend named Sierra in college. It’s a\n",
      "beautiful name, just like you.”\n",
      "The pretty blue-eyed Madison touched my arm, and I\n",
      "turned to her. “I really like your dress. Was it a lot of\n",
      "money?”\n",
      "“It was a gift to me. Maybe when you’re a little older ,\n",
      "you can buy something like this, something shiny .”\n",
      "“Who bought it?”\n",
      "Thinking I would point  Jack out, I looked over my\n",
      "shoulder . I was assumin g he would have his back to me\n",
      "since that was how I’d left him, but he had switched places\n",
      "with his friend and was talking to him while facing me. He\n",
      "glanced my way over his friend’s shoulder and our eyes\n",
      "met.\n",
      "I bit my lower lip and turned to Madison. “You see that\n",
      "guy over there talking to the man wearing a navy blue\n",
      "suit?”\n",
      "Both girls craned their necks to see who I was talking\n",
      "about.\n",
      "“Which one? The old one?” Sierra whispered.\n",
      "I looked back again and got caught in Jack’s gaze. Since\n",
      "he was already looking our way, even though I could see his\n",
      "mouth movin g as he talked to his friend, I pointed at him with my ﬁnger so the girls could see him. “Not the old one,\n",
      "the one in front of him. He has blue eyes and he is looking\n",
      "at us.” Turning back to them, I asked, “Did you see?”\n",
      "The girls giggled loudly .\n",
      "My head whipped back to Jack, but he was focused on\n",
      "his friend. I also noticed a few other people from the tables\n",
      "around us sending me disapproving looks. I couldn’t\n",
      "understand why , so I ignored them. “ What? What is it?”\n",
      "“He winked at us,” Maddy said, still grinning. “He is so\n",
      "big.”\n",
      "“Is he your boyfriend?” Sierra asked, now sitting\n",
      "sideways on her chair .\n",
      "“He is my…husband.” I touched her nose with my ﬁnger .\n",
      "Her grin got bigger .\n",
      "“I don’t have a boyfriend,” Maddy chimed in. “I’m too\n",
      "young.”\n",
      "“Believe me, you’re not missing out on anything.”\n",
      "“Boys can be stupid sometimes,” Sierra added, nodding.\n",
      "“Yeah, so stupid, and jerks, too,” I admitted. It was\n",
      "something they’d learn soon enough.\n",
      "When they started to giggle again, I started laughing\n",
      "with them, not caring that more heads had turned our way\n",
      "this time.\n",
      "“You tell your husband he is stupid, too?” Maddy\n",
      "whisper-yelled.\n",
      "“I told him he was a jerk tonight, right before we walked\n",
      "in here.”\n",
      "Both their eyes got huge. “ You didn’t!”\n",
      "“I did.” I shrugged. “He was being a jerk so I told him to\n",
      "stop it.”\n",
      "“But he is so much bigger than you.”\n",
      "“He is pretty big, isn’t he? Well, it doesn’t matter . Just\n",
      "because he is big doesn’t mean he gets to be a jerk.”\n",
      "Sierra nodded enthusiastically . “He is kinda cute,\n",
      "though.”\n",
      "“Yeah, cute,” Maddy mumbled. As I was about to say something, I felt a hand clasp my\n",
      "wrist and pull me up not so gently . Surprised, I gasped and\n",
      "almost lost my balance.\n",
      "“You’re emba rrassing us,” Bryan hissed, leaning in close\n",
      "and pulling me toward him at the same time.\n",
      "I tried to jerk my hand away , but his hold on me was\n",
      "tight and was starting to become painful. My brows drew\n",
      "together as I met his eyes. “What are you doing?” I\n",
      "whispered in confusion when I could ﬁnd my voice again.\n",
      "Before I got an answer , I felt a broad chest pressin g against\n",
      "my back, and just like that, Jack’s hand was on Bryan’s\n",
      "wrist. I didn’t know how much pressure he was applying,\n",
      "but Bryan let go of me immediately .\n",
      "Acting like nothing was wrong, my cousin looked around\n",
      "and smiled. “Try to control your wife, Hawthorne.” Then,\n",
      "pushing one hand into the pocket of his pants, he strolled\n",
      "away from us.\n",
      "Confused, hurt and more than a little surprised,  I just\n",
      "massaged my wrist.\n",
      "That broad, warm chest that was plastered behind me\n",
      "moved slightly so he could lean down and whisper into my\n",
      "ear. “What did he say?” he growled, and that gravelly voice\n",
      "did things to me—lots of things.\n",
      "I let go of my wrist and involuntarily pressed myself\n",
      "back, absorb ing more of his heat so I could whisper back.\n",
      "“Nothing.”\n",
      "“Rose—” he started in a low voice, his palm pressing\n",
      "against my stomach, keeping me in place.\n",
      "Keeping me with him.\n",
      "“It’s okay,” I interrupted, looking over my shoulder and\n",
      "into his eyes. His jaw clenched, but he didn’t say anything\n",
      "else.\n",
      "I remembere d where we were—or more impor tantly ,\n",
      "who I had been talking to just a few seconds earlier—so I\n",
      "turned back to the girls, who were staring up at us in\n",
      "confusion. “I’m sorry about that,” I apologized, shifting in place and\n",
      "facing them again. Jack stayed glued to my back, moving\n",
      "his body with me. It probably should’ve bothered me, his\n",
      "closeness, but I would’ve been lying to myself if I’d said it\n",
      "did. His hand curled around my waist and gave it a\n",
      "squeeze.\n",
      "“Uh…” It was so hard not to ﬁdget under his touch.\n",
      "“Girls, I’d like you to meet my husband, Jack. Jack, these\n",
      "are my new friends, Maddy and Sierra.”\n",
      "They both waved up at him, and I peered back to see\n",
      "him nodding at them with a serious expression on his face.\n",
      "“It’s a pleasure to meet you girls,” he said, so smoothly\n",
      "my heart went crazy in my chest. Those pesky little\n",
      "butterﬂies were back in my stomach, too .\n",
      "The girls were grinning again, so all was well.\n",
      "“Did Rose really call you a jerk tonight?” Sierra\n",
      "enquired boldly , staring up at him.\n",
      "I put my hand over Jack’s, which was still on my waist,\n",
      "and looked back at him, too. He sighed and managed to\n",
      "change his expression to a really guilty one. I couldn’t hold\n",
      "back my smile.\n",
      "“I’m afraid she did.”\n",
      "“You didn’t get angry?” Maddy quipped with big eyes.\n",
      "“She was telling the truth. I was being a jerk, so I\n",
      "couldn’t get angry at her .”\n",
      "“Rose said boys are stupid and jerks,” Sierra put in.\n",
      "I feigned a shocked expression. “You’re telling on me to\n",
      "my husband, Sierra? I told you that in secret.”\n",
      "The giggles started again  and I couldn’t keep a straight\n",
      "face. My smile got bigger when Jack played his role\n",
      "perfectly by leaning down and pressing a soft kiss on my\n",
      "cheek.\n",
      "“I’m afraid I’m going to have to agree with my wife.\n",
      "Boys are stupid. And sometimes jerks, I’m afraid.”\n",
      "God, who was this man exactly? Both of them  had heart eyes as they stared up at Jack. I\n",
      "was afraid I had them as well.\n",
      "“Would it be okay if I stole my wife for a little while?”\n",
      "Jack asked the girls. I didn’t want to leave, but they needed\n",
      "to eat their dinner , and I didn’t want to attract any\n",
      "attention to myself and embarrass Jack in any way .\n",
      "“Will you come back?” Maddy asked, and I nodded.\n",
      "“I will. Promise.”\n",
      "“Okay . Bye!”\n",
      "We got some more waves  then, with his arm still around\n",
      "my waist and my hand on his, Jack guided me back to our\n",
      "table. I realized the emcee wasn’t on the stage anymore\n",
      "and there were no other speakers. I felt and, more than\n",
      "that, noticed curious eyes on us, some of them likely\n",
      "disapproving, but I kept a small smile on my face and made\n",
      "sure not to glance at the table where Joshua and the rest of\n",
      "them sat.\n",
      "When we reached our table, instead of sitting down like\n",
      "I’d assumed we would, Jack pulled me over, a little to the\n",
      "left, out of the way of the waiters changing out plates and\n",
      "delivering more drink orders. We were still out in the open,\n",
      "and we could still be seen clearly by everyone.\n",
      "“What did he say to you?” he asked as soon as he was\n",
      "standing in front of me. None of our body parts were\n",
      "touching anymore. I didn’t know about him, but I certainly\n",
      "felt the loss.\n",
      "“He didn’t say anything important, Jack,” I assured him,\n",
      "putting my hand on his arm then pulling it back. “There is\n",
      "nothing to get angry about.”\n",
      "“Then you can say what he said.”\n",
      "“But it doesn’t matter .”\n",
      "“I can be the judge of that.”\n",
      "I tilted my head and sighed. “Jack.” He just waited with\n",
      "that same cool expression  on his face, and I released a long\n",
      "sigh. Knowin g him, he could keep that expression for a long time. “If you promise you won’t go over or say something to\n",
      "him, I’ll tell you.”\n",
      "I got a sharp nod and nothing else.\n",
      "I sighed, more heavily this time. “He just said I was\n",
      "embarrassing them. The girls were laughing, and I think\n",
      "some of the tables that were close by got annoyed. I don’t\n",
      "think I did anything to embarrass you, but if I did I’m—”\n",
      "His eyes bored into mine as his jaw tightened. “Don’t\n",
      "even ﬁnish that senten ce, Rose. You didn’t embarrass\n",
      "anyone. You made two little girls’ night.” He looked away\n",
      "for a moment and I watc hed his features soften.  Then he\n",
      "lifted his hand in a wave and, curious, I followed his gaze to\n",
      "see the girls waving at us enthusiastically with big smiles\n",
      "on their faces. I smiled back and turned to Jack, the smile\n",
      "still strong. “They think you’re big, and cute—and Sierra\n",
      "thinks I’m pretty .”\n",
      "“You are pretty .” His eyes were still on the girls, and he\n",
      "didn’t even realize he was making my heart do a little\n",
      "somersault. “But cute?” he asked as his eyes came back to\n",
      "me with my favorite frown on his face. “I’m oﬀended.”\n",
      "“Aww, don’t be. Y ou are cute, in a grumpy sort of way .”\n",
      "I laugh ed, and his eyes dropped to my mouth, causing\n",
      "me to bite on my lower lip as I quickly lost the big smile.\n",
      "His eyes ﬂicked up to mine, the blue somehow looking even\n",
      "deeper in the low lighting of the room, then his stare went\n",
      "right back to my lips. Completely mesmerized, I watched a\n",
      "smile tug at the corners of his mouth.\n",
      "I swore  I didn’t breathe for a few seconds and just stood\n",
      "there gawking up at him, entranced.\n",
      "Finally , ﬁnally  his mouth curved into a smile. It had only\n",
      "taken us a bit more than a month. It was probably my own\n",
      "fault, but my God! It’d been a long wait, a pretty long wait\n",
      "that had been worth it because when he smiled… when the\n",
      "skin around his eyes gently crinkled, turning his expression\n",
      "into something completely diﬀerent than what it was when\n",
      "he was frowning…I simply couldn’t stop staring. My heart soared as if I had just accomplished something big, and for\n",
      "me, it was big—so big that I couldn’t stop myself from\n",
      "beaming up at him.\n",
      "“Is that a smile I just saw, Mr. Hawthorne?” I asked, still\n",
      "a little stupeﬁed. “This is the ﬁrst time you’ve smiled at me.\n",
      "I’ve been trying to count them since week one, and this is\n",
      "number one. A smile…I can’t believe it. I wish I had my\n",
      "phone with me so I could capture this moment. We need to\n",
      "have cake to celebrate.”\n",
      "I looked to my right and left to conﬁrm that I wasn’t the\n",
      "only one witnessing this, but even though I was glancing\n",
      "around, I didn’t see anyone. The entire room could’ve been\n",
      "staring at us, including Joshua, but I didn’t see a single\n",
      "person other than Jack Hawthorne. This was actually not\n",
      "good news for me, the fake wife, but I didn’t care one bit\n",
      "about that. I’d consider that later, much later, when I was\n",
      "over that smile.\n",
      "His smile softened, but it was still there. “You’ve been\n",
      "counting my smiles?”\n",
      "“Trying’ being the operative word here since you like to\n",
      "hoard them like a squirrel hoarding his nuts.”\n",
      "“I’ve smiled at you, Rose.” He lifted his hand and tucked\n",
      "my hair behind my ear. I didn’t think much about it because\n",
      "I was busy shaking my head at him.\n",
      "“You haven’t.”\n",
      "“Maybe you weren’t looking.”\n",
      "“Are you kidding me? I’ve been looking nonstop.” I lifted\n",
      "a ﬁnger between us and his gaze dropped to it. “One time—\n",
      "there was one time I thought I saw your lips twitch, but it\n",
      "was a false alarm, and that’s it.”\n",
      "I was still grinning, but when I looked at his lips, he had\n",
      "lost the smile and the expression on his face was much\n",
      "more intense. He took a step forward into me and my pulse\n",
      "quickened. When his big, warm hand cupped my face,\n",
      "covering almost the entire left half, I noticed the shift in the\n",
      "air and stood still. Oh, this is not good.\n",
      "Eyes locked on mine, he lowered his head just a few\n",
      "inches away from my lips and whispered, “I’m going to kiss\n",
      "you now , Rose.” His eyes were still open and on mine.\n",
      "I swallowed.\n",
      "“What?” I croaked, and then I cleared my throat, stuck\n",
      "in place, staring into the depths of his eyes. His gaze\n",
      "moved from  my eyes to my lips. “I knew this was a\n",
      "possibility tonight, of course,” I whispered. “But is someone\n",
      "looking?” We needed to put on a show and I supposed the\n",
      "time had come, but why was I suddenly freaking out on the\n",
      "inside? It wasn’t like we were gonna suck each other’s\n",
      "faces in the middle of a charity event.\n",
      "“Do you care if someone is looking?” he asked.\n",
      "I mean …that was the whole reason for the kiss, wasn’t\n",
      "it? But did I care? Not really , I supposed. A peck on the lips\n",
      "was nothing.  I took a deep breath and nodded, letting it out\n",
      "in a whoosh.  “Okay . Right. Lay it on me. Let’s do this.” As\n",
      "his eyes swept over my face, I steeled my voice . “A little\n",
      "faster than that,” I whisp ered, keeping my voice as low as\n",
      "possible. “Not like a turtle, remember?”\n",
      "A smile danced on his lips again as if he found what I\n",
      "said extreme ly funny , but he managed to drop his forehead\n",
      "against mine and our noses touched.\n",
      "My heart started beating in my throat when his arm\n",
      "rounded my waist and he pulled me just a little closer .\n",
      "Made sense too, I supposed, because I couldn’t just keep\n",
      "my face close but my body away . Closing my eyes, I\n",
      "swallowed hard. My hands were instinctively resting on his\n",
      "chest. This was going to be one epic peck, and I hoped the\n",
      "people aroun d who were watching—whoever they were—\n",
      "appreciated our acting.\n",
      "His hand was still covering my cheek. “Are you ready for\n",
      "me, Rose?” Jack whisper ed in a low, insistent voice, and I\n",
      "smelled the whiskey and mint on his breath.\n",
      "“You’re still taking it too slow—you need to—” I didn’ t get the chance to utter another word because\n",
      "Jack’s lips were on mine, and we were not sharin g a nice\n",
      "little romantic peck. No, his tongue was already sweeping\n",
      "in and teasing mine. For a moment, I wasn’t sure what I\n",
      "should do. We hadn’t done this even on the day we’d said I\n",
      "do. My eyes were still open, and I felt a little desper ate to\n",
      "end whateve r he had started. I even tried to, twice, both\n",
      "times thinking Okay , this is it, he is stopping now so you\n",
      "need to stop too, but the more he teased me with the way\n",
      "he slowly coaxed me into the kiss, pulling me deeper , the\n",
      "more I felt myself slipping. Finally , my eyes started to close\n",
      "on their own. It wasn’t that I wasn’t responding—I  was, had\n",
      "been from the moment his lips touched mine—bu t up until\n",
      "that point, I’d been doing it reluctantly , thinking the entire\n",
      "time it would end in the next second, thinking he’d stop\n",
      "after just one more beat. I was doing my very best to hold\n",
      "myself back, trying my very , very best not to enjoy our kiss.\n",
      "Then when he suddenly stopped, I could’ve cried. I\n",
      "wasn’t sure if it was from relief or sorrow . Thankfully , he\n",
      "didn’t pull back complete ly, and I only swayed toward him a\n",
      "little. I forced myself to open my eyes.\n",
      "“Am I doing okay?” he asked against my already swollen\n",
      "lips, his eyes staring straight into mine. The hairs on my\n",
      "arms stood up and his eyes became my entire focus. They\n",
      "looked darker , deeper , and deep ocean blue became my\n",
      "absolute favorite new color .\n",
      "I cleared my throat and tried to move my head up and\n",
      "down in a nod. “I mean, it depends on what you’re going\n",
      "for, but much better , er, than a turtle…I think.”\n",
      "“You think so?” His gravelly voice caused my eyelids to\n",
      "droop, and the way he used his left hand to swipe some of\n",
      "my bangs out of my face, the backs of his ﬁngers gently\n",
      "grazing my temple…\n",
      "Biting on my lip so I wouldn’t do something stupid, I\n",
      "took a deep breath, nodded, and forced my eyes to open. In\n",
      "the same second, he was on my lips again. As slow and sweet as it had started with his ﬁrst kiss, with this one, the\n",
      "more his tongue swirled in my mouth, the more he tilted his\n",
      "head and tried to get in deeper , the further I slipp ed into a\n",
      "dark hole I never wanted  to come out of. His hand at my\n",
      "back pulled me forward, a barely noticeable inch or two,\n",
      "but it made it impossible for me not to arch my back and\n",
      "help him along. I wasn’t into public displays of aﬀection at\n",
      "all, but I forgot about every single person that was in that\n",
      "huge ballroo m with us. I could’ve been standing in the\n",
      "middle of a stadium in Jack’s arms going at it full force and\n",
      "probably still wouldn’t have cared in that moment.\n",
      "It was a little rough, our kiss, and somehow I think I\n",
      "knew it’d be like that with him. Rough and demanding and\n",
      "consuming. Knew it even before this madness had started.\n",
      "When my tongue got its own idea and started to get\n",
      "more into it, I rose up on my toes, basically climbing him\n",
      "with my arms to get more of him, this prickly and rough-\n",
      "around-the-edges man who was apparently mine in public\n",
      "for the better part of the next two years. Leaning in harder\n",
      "to get more,  his hand slipped from my cheek to cradle my\n",
      "neck. I felt his other arm go around my waist, bringing me\n",
      "ﬂush with his chest. Maybe he wasn’t that good at\n",
      "communicating with me, but he sure was good at this.\n",
      "Something I couldn’t exactly identify was rising up to\n",
      "the surface inside of me, and to be honest, more than\n",
      "happy to be that close, I wrapped my own arms around his\n",
      "neck and a groan slipped  from my lips. That was when he\n",
      "suddenly stopped and pulled back. He wasn’t as out of\n",
      "breath as I was, but he was deﬁnitely breathing hard.\n",
      "Flushed, I just stared up at him in wonder . What the hell\n",
      "had just happened? Was he trying for an Oscar or\n",
      "something? Had he felt whatever I had felt there for a\n",
      "second? A minute? Or had it been an hour?\n",
      "I quietly cleared my throat and dropped my arms, ﬁxing\n",
      "my dress under his stare . Turning my head slightly to the\n",
      "right, I wiped my mouth  with my ﬁngers because I didn’t think it was a good idea to keep licking my lips trying to\n",
      "taste him again.\n",
      "Facing him, I started, “ Jack, I—”\n",
      "“Your ex-ﬁancé is staring,” he said in a calm voice. His\n",
      "breathing didn’t appear to be labored anymore, so opposite\n",
      "of what I was feeling.\n",
      "I stiﬀe ned but didn’t look back to where I knew Jack had\n",
      "just glanced or had probably kept glancing while he was\n",
      "kissing me. So, this was just a show . My stomach dropped\n",
      "and I let go of what I had been about to say. His kiss had\n",
      "been just a show . I mean…of course it was a show . I already\n",
      "knew that—he had given me a warning, for Christ’s sake. It\n",
      "wasn’t like he had smiled at me and then lost control and\n",
      "kissed me because he just couldn’t stop himself . Nope. He\n",
      "had given me plenty of warning, but…but for a second\n",
      "there, I had lost myself in the kiss and had forgotten. For a\n",
      "second there, I had thought he was actually , maybe… It had\n",
      "probably just been a ﬂuke. I shook my head, trying to get\n",
      "rid of the haze clouding my brain and return to reality. Jack\n",
      "was a good kisser—so what? Maybe I could simply wait for\n",
      "the next public event when he thought we should lock lips\n",
      "again, just enjoy it for what it was, and not think too much\n",
      "about it.\n",
      "When Jack pulled my chair out for me to sit down, I\n",
      "studied him a bit more carefully out of the corner of my eye\n",
      "as I took my seat. His face was as it always was: set and\n",
      "aloof , his expression cool and unreadable. If his lips hadn’t\n",
      "been a little more reddish because of my lipstick\n",
      "transferring onto them, I wouldn’t have even guessed he\n",
      "had just kissed someone—kissed me. There was absolutely\n",
      "no evidence left of what we had just shared.\n",
      "Feeling confused, I picked up my fork and didn’t even\n",
      "realize my plate had been switched out for some sort of\n",
      "chicken dish as I dug in without another word. Jack and I\n",
      "were quiet for a long time, letting other voices ﬁll the\n",
      "heavy silence between us. “You think that was better than a turtle?” he asked after\n",
      "the better part of ﬁfteen minutes had passed in silence. The\n",
      "event was plenty loud, and he had to lean toward  me so I\n",
      "could hear him. The other two couples sitting across from\n",
      "us weren’t exactly silent as they laughed out loud in a way\n",
      "that made me cringe every time it started up again . I had to\n",
      "lean toward Jack as I had him repeat his words. My\n",
      "stomach still wasn’t sitting right after the whole thing.\n",
      "“Oh yeah, that was very professional.” I winced and\n",
      "tried to salva ge the moment. “As in I think we did a very\n",
      "good job of making people believe this is a real thing\n",
      "between us.” It had almost fooled me, too—almost.\n",
      "“Hopefully I wasn’t too bad either?” I asked lightly , trying\n",
      "to look like I didn’t care much about it either way but at the\n",
      "same time regretting the words as soon as they left my\n",
      "mouth because I was curious, dammit.\n",
      "I broke a piece of bread in half and stuﬀed the whole\n",
      "thing in my mouth.\n",
      "“No, you were ﬁne.”\n",
      "My chewing slowed down  as I processed his words then\n",
      "I force d myself to swallow the bread that tasted so much\n",
      "like cardboard.\n",
      "“Great,” I mumbled, low enough that he didn’t hear me.\n",
      "I was ﬁne.\n",
      "He leaned in again, his arm carelessly slung on the back\n",
      "of my chair . “What did you say?”\n",
      "I leane d away , nothing obvious, just a little, as I reached\n",
      "out for my second glass of white wine. A hell of a headache\n",
      "would be waiting for me when I woke up the next morning.\n",
      "I just knew it.\n",
      "“Nothing,” I mumbled into my wine, and Jack leaned in\n",
      "closer , his shoulder on my back. I couldn’t lean away\n",
      "because the damn wine glass was already in my hand.\n",
      "“You need to stop talking into your beverage. Is\n",
      "everything okay?” I put the wine glass down, took a breath as I did so, and\n",
      "then set my eyes on his jaw. “Everything is ﬁne, just a little\n",
      "tired after all the excitement—not the kissing part,\n",
      "obviously . That wasn’t much of a workout. Easy peasy .”\n",
      "Stop moving your lips, Rose.\n",
      "“Why are you not looking at me?”\n",
      "“I’m looking at you.” I looked down at his pants and then\n",
      "at the table where his left hand was resting, turning the\n",
      "whiskey glass around and around—anywhere but his eyes.\n",
      "Then I got pissed at myself and looked straight  into his\n",
      "eyes with a raise of my eyebrow .\n",
      "He stared at me in silence for a good twenty seconds,\n",
      "and I stared right back. Nothing was going on between us.\n",
      "This was Jack. This was temporary . I was the one who was\n",
      "making things awkward by trying to put some meaning\n",
      "behind something that didn’t…well, it didn’t mean\n",
      "anything. He had told me he was about to kiss me and then\n",
      "he’d kissed me. It wasn’t anything new. Everyone kissed\n",
      "with their mouths and tongues; we hadn’t done anything\n",
      "special.\n",
      "His jaw tightened and he stood up.\n",
      "“I need to check on a few clients then we can leave.”\n",
      "I opened my mouth to say something, but he had already\n",
      "walked away . When the waiter presented the dessert, I\n",
      "gave him a forced smile. It looked like some sort of eclair\n",
      "with three dots of something green on the side. A jam?\n",
      "Sauce? I had no idea. Making sure certain people weren’t\n",
      "looking at me, I looked over my right shoulder and found\n",
      "Maddy and Sierra; they were six, seven tables behind us.\n",
      "When I caught Maddy’s eyes, I smiled warmly and waved at\n",
      "her. She enthusiastically waved back.\n",
      "My gaze searched for Jack next, and I found him talking\n",
      "to an elderly man a few tables away from the girls. I faced\n",
      "forward and accidentally  met the eyes of one of the guys\n",
      "sitting at our table. The ladies were absent, and the other\n",
      "man was busy talking on his phone quite loudly . The one whose eyes I’d met gave  me a sly smile and lifted his red\n",
      "wine glass in a salute. I looked away .\n",
      "“Are you enjoying your night?” he asked. He was the one\n",
      "sitting closest to me on my right, and since the other guy\n",
      "was still on his phone, he couldn’t have been talking to\n",
      "anyone but me.\n",
      "I forced a small smile and nodded at him.\n",
      "“I’m Anthony .”\n",
      "Because I was the most intelligent person alive, I acted\n",
      "as if I couldn’t hear him, pushed my chair back, grabbed\n",
      "my plate with two hands, and found myself heading back to\n",
      "the table where the girls were sitting. Obviously , you never\n",
      "leave your dessert behind. When they noticed me coming,\n",
      "both Maddy’s and Sierra ’s subdued faces broke out into a\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "This time, because I didn’t want to embarrass Jack, I\n",
      "asked a waiter if they could bring me a chair , and while\n",
      "standing betw een the girls with a dessert plate in my hand,\n",
      "I asked the chaperone if she’d mind if I joined the girls.\n",
      "When I got the okay and the chair , I sat between them and\n",
      "started chatting.\n",
      "When they asked me if my husband had left me behind, I\n",
      "found Jack in the busy ballroom in a second and pointed\n",
      "him out. He was standin g with his hands in his pockets\n",
      "again. He actually looke d really good in a tux. His eyes\n",
      "found mine and, having been caught, I quickly looked away .\n",
      "When I found the girls contemplating how to eat the\n",
      "eclairs on their plate, I reached for mine with my ﬁngers. It\n",
      "was easier , and also, I’d left everything else at my table and\n",
      "had nothing else to use. The girls relaxed when they saw\n",
      "me and attacked their own eclairs with such joy that I\n",
      "smiled at them. As we talked about random things and ate\n",
      "our desserts, I snuck glances at Jack, acutely aware of\n",
      "where he was the entire time.\n",
      "When he ﬁnally got back  to my side, it was hard to say\n",
      "goodbye to the girls. I kissed them both on their cheeks and waved goodbye as they giggled behind our back s. I was\n",
      "sure the giggles were all for Jack, who had actua lly kissed\n",
      "their little hands and bid them a good night, stealing more\n",
      "pieces of my heart in the process.\n",
      "As we were waiting for our coats to be brought out, Jack\n",
      "pointed at my lips with his ﬁngers. He was smiling softly .\n",
      "“There is chocolate around your lips.”\n",
      "I closed my eyes as I felt a rush of heat hit my cheeks.\n",
      "Way to go, Rose. W ay to go .\n",
      "“I’ll be right back!”\n",
      "“Rose, no, we need to—”\n",
      "“Just a minute!” Yelling  at him over my shoulder , I\n",
      "rushed to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. Sure\n",
      "enough, on the left edge  of my mouth were the tell-tale\n",
      "signs of chocolate, and even worse than that, my runny\n",
      "nose was starting to make an appearance again. At least he\n",
      "hadn’t noticed that in the dark.\n",
      "Pulling the completely soaked—yet again—tissue paper\n",
      "out of my nose, I tilted my head back when I felt a rush of\n",
      "liquid trailing down. Groaning, I made another ball of paper\n",
      "and pushed it up my nose, hoping it’d hold until we could\n",
      "reach the apartment. The last thing I wanted was for Jack\n",
      "to see me with a runny nose.\n",
      "When I was done I rushed back to him. “Sorry , sorry .”\n",
      "“You don’t have to apologize to me. It’s ﬁne,” he\n",
      "murmured.\n",
      "A lot of things were ﬁne this evening.\n",
      "He held up my jacket and when I hesitated for a second,\n",
      "he raised an eyebrow and just waited. I pushed my arms in\n",
      "and let him settle the heavy weight of it on my shoulders. I\n",
      "turned to face him so we could leave and bundled myself\n",
      "tighter in my coat, knowin g I was about to freeze my ass oﬀ\n",
      "the second I stepped outside.\n",
      "Jack was right beside me as he opened the door, and I\n",
      "took my ﬁrst step into the cold and busy night. With my\n",
      "right hand, I held the collar of my jacket closed and breathed out, watching it puﬀ out in a cloud in front of me.\n",
      "On my third step, a warm  hand gently slipped around my\n",
      "left one without a word, and I climbed down the stairs hand\n",
      "in hand with my husband  as if it was the most natural thing\n",
      "in the world.\n",
      "The number of times Jack Hawthorne smiled: three.\n",
      "(VICTOR Y IS MINE.) ICHAPTER FOURTEEN\n",
      "ROSE\n",
      "woke up in the middle of the night with a loud gasp and\n",
      "a light sheen of sweat covering my body. My breathing\n",
      "was labored and my heart rate was a little faster than I\n",
      "would’ve liked it to be. Feeling dazed and not sure where I\n",
      "was exactly , I looked around. The room was dark, but as my\n",
      "eyes adjusted to the sliver of light coming through the\n",
      "terrace doors thanks to the moon, I realized where I was: in\n",
      "my room at Jack’s apartm ent, where I had gone to sleep,\n",
      "but… I closed my eyes and groaned, letting myself drop\n",
      "back to my pillow . I turned to my side, facing the terrace\n",
      "doors, and just stared at nothing. It was…Sunday night, the\n",
      "night after the charity event.\n",
      "And I had just dreamed of Jack.\n",
      "I was so incredibly aware that what I had just seen\n",
      "wasn’t real, but it had felt real— real enough that I felt a\n",
      "vast emptine ss inside me. I swallowed and turned onto my\n",
      "back, staring  at the dark ceiling, trying to rein in my\n",
      "emotions. I could still feel his arms around me, his touch,\n",
      "could feel and hear his voice right next to my ear. I couldn’t\n",
      "remember the words, but I’d remember that low, gruﬀ\n",
      "sound anywhere now, and when I’d looked back  over my\n",
      "shoulder , Jack had been right there smiling at me.\n",
      "I lifted my hand and touched my cheek where I could\n",
      "still feel the prickly sensation, a remnant of his stubble rubbing against my cheek. It felt so real that I had to close\n",
      "my eyes and try to feel the ghost of his touch.\n",
      "I was screwed.\n",
      "It all had felt so real.\n",
      "In my dream, I was in love with Jack, and I was pretty\n",
      "sure he was in love with me too. When he kissed me, just a\n",
      "slow graze of his lips on mine, there had been no one\n",
      "around. It was just us. Then he smiled against my lips. We\n",
      "had both smiled, and I’d wrapped my arms around his neck\n",
      "and forced him into a longer , more satisfying kiss. I’d never\n",
      "felt a happiness like that. When we’d come up for air, we\n",
      "had both been smiling, him pushing my hair out of my face\n",
      "with his hand s, our foreheads resting against each  other as\n",
      "we caught our breaths.\n",
      "There had been no one around.\n",
      "No one to show oﬀ for .\n",
      "Just us.\n",
      "My feelings hadn’t just disappeared suddenly like the\n",
      "dream, though. They hadn’t changed. I could still\n",
      "remember what I’d felt. I still wanted him and that, more\n",
      "than anythin g, scared the hell out of me, because it wasn’t\n",
      "real and yet I could still feel it.\n",
      "I breathed in and out of my mouth and kicked oﬀ the\n",
      "covers. It was too hot inside the room.\n",

      "This was all happening because of that damn kiss and all\n",
      "that touching  and smiling at the charity event. I knew it,\n",
      "but the dream had been too much. Feeling so good about something, feeling so happy and then having that feeling\n",

      "Saturday night had ended as soon as we got back to the\n",

      "seeing Jodi and Bryan and Joshua. And I…instead of sitting\n",
      "down and trying to process the fact that Joshua was now\n",
      "with my cousin and maybe—probably—had left me for her, I\n",
      "had been stuck on the kiss I had shared with Jack. Joshua\n",
      "hadn’t occupied my mind for more than a few ﬂeeting\n",

      "Sunday morning when I woke up, thinking maybe we\n",
      "could have breakfast together since I wasn’t opening the\n",

      "knocking on his door and going into his room, only to ﬁnd\n",
      "him already gone. If someone asked, I wouldn’t admit it,\n",
      "but I had waited around until two PM, and when he hadn’t\n",
      "shown up, I’d decided to go to the coﬀee shop and spend\n",
      "time in the kitchen baking instead. I’d picked up my phone\n",
      "countless times, thinking maybe sending a quick text\n",
      "asking what he was doing wouldn’t be such a bad idea, but\n",
      "I hadn’t ever gone through with it.\n",
      "He hadn’t contacted me either .\n",
      "Heading back to the apartment at eight PM, nothing had\n",

      "him, but I wanted  very much to see him and be around him.\n",
      "When I had gone to bed at eleven, he still hadn’t been\n",
      "around.\n",
      "Massaging my temples, I sighed and blindly reached for\n",
      "my phone on the nightstand. I didn’t know why my\n",
      "heartbeat quickened when I took a quick look at the screen\n",
      "and scrolled through a few messages from Sally; there was\n",
      "nothing from  Jack there, no calls, no texts—and why would he call or text me anyw ay? We weren’t that. We weren’t\n",
      "ever going to be that, no matter what dreams I had.\n",
      "Thoroughly annoyed with myself for being so aﬀected\n",
      "just by a simple dream, I got up to my feet and looked for\n",
      "something I could wear over my panties. I left the simple\n",
      "short-sleeved thin grey t-shirt on and quietly left my room.\n",
      "The only positive thing for the night was that my nose\n",
      "wasn’t running at that particular moment, and it looked like\n",
      "I was over whatever allergic reaction or ﬂu had crossed my\n",
      "path.\n",
      "When I made it to the staircase, I paused and glanced\n",
      "toward Jack’ s room but didn’t dare go anywhere near it.\n",
      "Slowly going  down the stairs, I decided a cold glass of\n",
      "water would be just the thing to wake me up from stupid\n",

      "I’d made sure.\n",
      "As if that wasn’t enough for the day, before I could  leave\n",
      "the oﬀice Joshua had showed up. Everything was piling up\n",
      "and I was slowly getting buried underneath it all.\n",
      "So I was in my study at three AM, doing nothin g but\n",
      "making myself miserable instead of going to bed…just a\n",
      "few doors down from her .\n",
      "When there was a hesitan t knock on the door, I snapped\n",
      "out of my thoughts.\n",
      "“Come in.”\n",
      "First, her head peeked in, her shoulders and body\n",
      "hidden behind the door .\n",
      "“Hey , Jack.”\n",
      "“Hey .”\n",
      "“Am I bothering you? Can I come in?”\n",
      "If I’d been sure it wouldn’t startle her, I’d have laughed\n",
      "out loud. She wasn’t bothering me enough—that was the\n",

      "email I had just received.\n",
      "“Please, come in,” I repeated, and she ﬁnally showed her\n",
      "entire body and stepped in, closing the door and leaning\n",
      "her back against it. I wasn’t sure how long I could keep my\n",
      "hands oﬀ of her or how wise it was to be in a secluded\n",
      "room together like this, but I didn’t care.\n",
      "“I woke up,” she said, softly smiling at me. “Couldn’t go\n",
      "back to sleep.”\n",
      "Rose was wearing black leggings and a light grey t-shirt\n",
      "that did nothing to hide her yellow lace bra underneath it. I\n",
      "had lost my tie somewhere when I’d walked into a quiet\n",
      "apartment, but I was still wearing the white button-up and\n",
      "black slacks I had put on that morning. She looked\n",
      "beautiful even disheveled, whereas I must have looked like\n",
      "a mess.\n",
      "“What are you doing?” she asked when I didn’t say\n",
      "anything.\n",
      "“Something came up that I had to deal with.”\n",
      "She pushed herself oﬀ the door, slowly approaching with\n",
      "her hand behind her back. “ You still have work to do?”\n",
      "I gave a sharp nod.\n",
      "“I didn’t see you today .”\n",
      "Had she been  hoping to see me? I didn’t think so. “I was\n",

      "“I thought you didn’t work every weekend.” She was a\n",
      "few steps closer , and I was aware of each and every one of\n",
      "those steps. Her gaze slowly took in everything in the room\n",
      "but me.\n",
      "Rising from my seat, I rounded my desk and sat on the\n",
      "edge of it. I had to shove my hands into my pockets so I\n",
      "wouldn’t grab her, but I needed to be closer . I sat still on\n",
      "my perch and watched her slow movements as she walked\n",
      "up to the bookshelves and strolled the length of them, pausing once or twice to check a title, her ﬁngertips softly\n",
      "grazing each spine.\n",
      "“No, not every weekend. Did you need something?”\n",
      "She stopped perusing the books and focused on me. “If\n",

      "“You are not bothering me, Rose. Did you want to talk\n",
      "about something?”\n",

      "the books. “Nothing in particular . Like I said, I couldn’t\n",
      "sleep.”\n",
      "“Okay .”\n",
      "She turned to me, keeping her back against the\n",
      "bookcase. “ Will you go to bed?”\n",
      "“At some point, yes.”\n",
      "“Good. That’s good. Sleep is good.”\n",
      "With even slower steps, she drew closer to me, her eyes\n",
      "moving around the room.\n",
      "“You have a beautiful apartment,” she murmured, and I\n",
      "frowned at her .\n",
      "“Rose? Are you okay?”\n",
      "She hated when I asked her that question. I knew that,\n",
      "but I loved her reactions too much to quit asking.\n",
      "She sighed. “ Yeah, sure. Why?”\n",
      "“You’re acting weird.”\n",
      "She waved a hand in front of her, dismissing my words.\n",
      "Then, standing next to me, she put her hand on my desk.\n",
      "“This is a beautiful desk,” she said.\n",
      "Something was deﬁnitely wrong with her .\n",
      "“It’s a desk,” I agreed in a ﬂat tone.\n",
      "Her lips twitched, and my gaze focused on that tiny\n",
      "movement. I was losing my mind. Being so close yet so far\n",
      "away from her was wreaking havoc on my self -control.\n",
      "She released a deep breath and ﬁnally met my eyes, no\n",
      "trace of the smile I had become so enamored with. “So…at\n",
      "the event…we…did a good job, right?”\n",
      "“A good job? Of what?” “Of being husband and wife. I need to try something, so\n",
      "can you just stay still?”\n",
      "My eyebrows  rose in confusion, but I simply gave her a\n",
      "sharp nod, not having any idea where she was going with\n",
      "this.\n",
      "She licked her lips and puﬀed up her cheeks before\n",
      "letting out a long breath. Then she took two more steps\n",
      "forward until her chest was only an inch or two away from\n",
      "my shoulder .\n",
      "I stiﬀe ned, my hands twitching in my pockets. Not sure\n",
      "what she was about to do, I had to take my right hand out\n",
      "and grip the edge of my desk. Her focus was on my lips,\n",
      "and I watche d her bite down on her bottom lip then lean in\n",
      "close.\n",
      "Her eyes ﬂitted between my eyes and my lips.\n",
      "“It’s just…I’ll…”\n",
      "Then she leaned forward, and I covered the remaining\n",
      "space between us until her lips ﬁnally touched mine,\n",
      "pressing a soft kiss on the edge of my mouth. Her eyes still\n",
      "closed, she pulled back and made a noncommittal sound.\n",
      "“Huh.”\n",
      "To say I was surprised would be an understatement, but\n",
      "I didn’t dare move, scared I would break the spell of\n",
      "whatever was going on. I just kept my eyes on her beautiful\n",
      "face and tried to read what she was thinking. Then she took\n",
      "another step forward, and I swear to God I felt her nipples\n",
      "press into my chest.\n",
      "She swallowed and put her hand on my cheek.\n",
      "“What are you doing, Rose?” I asked, unable to hold\n",
      "back anymore. My voice sounded rough to my ears.\n",
      "“I’m just trying something.” She looked into my eyes.\n",
      "“Could you close your eyes?”\n",
      "I raised an eyebrow in question.\n",
      "“Just for a quick second. Promise.”\n",
      "I sighe d, slightly annoyed that she didn’t want me to\n",
      "watch her , to take in her features when she was standing so close to me. My ﬁngers gripped the desk tighter , but I did\n",
      "as she’d asked.\n",
      "“It’s just…you’re making me nervous when you frown at\n",
      "me like that. This’ll only take a second, I promise.”\n",
      "My lips parted to give her an answer , but no sound came\n",
      "out because her lips had found mine again. I responded to\n",
      "her gentle kiss and opened my eyes anyway so I could\n",
      "watch her. She had already closed hers, and her hand was\n",
      "slightly trembling against my cheek. Tilting her head, she\n",
      "deepened the kiss, her left hand pressing on my chest as\n",
      "she rose higher . I dipped my head down and closed my\n",
      "eyes, feeling drunk with her kiss.\n",
      "She pulled back before I could take over completely , and\n",
      "we just stood there a few inches apart, her breath coming\n",
      "out in little pants. My heart hammering in my chest, I\n",
      "studied her as her eyes slowly opened and she made a face\n",
      "like something wasn’t quite right.\n",
      "Scrunching her nose, she gave me a look I couldn’t\n",
      "interpret.\n",
      "I cleared my throat. “Not good?”\n",
      "She lifted her hand betw een us, rocking it from side to\n",
      "side. “Ehhh.”\n",
      "“I see. Turtle again?”\n",
      "Another noncommittal sound.\n",
      "“Right. And this was important…why?”\n",
      "She huﬀed and thought about her answer for a second.\n",
      "“Kinda like practice, maybe? Saturday was a little weird, so\n",
      "I thought we could work on it, so it looks more natural?”\n",
      "“So Saturday was bad?  I didn’t realize you had a\n",
      "problem with my kiss. You seemed okay with it then, but\n",
      "now you think we should work on it?”\n",
      "“I mean…I didn’t have anything better to do, so…”\n",
      "“Right.”\n",
      "I waited, my eyes on her .\n",
      "“Maybe one more time? Just…you know , to see what\n",
      "we’re doing wrong.” “Sure. Any pointers you’d like to give?”\n",
      "She took me seriously and thought about it some more. I\n",
      "was having trouble keep ing a straight face but decided to\n",
      "play along. I didn’t buy into her bullshit, but if she wanted\n",
      "to kiss, I wasn’t gonna argue.\n",
      "“Would more tongue be weird for you?” she asked.\n",
      "My lips twitched, and I smiled.\n",
      "“What?”\n",
      "Clearing my throat, I shook my head. “Nothing. I’m not\n",
      "sure about the tongue,” I ventured. “If you think  that’s a\n",
      "good idea, I’ll have to give it a try .”\n",
      "“Okay .” She sighed and put a hand on my shoulder .\n",
      "“Then…yeah. Okay , let’s try that.”\n",
      "After another deep breath , she took one small little step.\n",
      "Her eyes were already closed so she missed my smile.\n",
      "Taking my other hand out of my pocket, I brushed her\n",
      "bangs away , relaxed my hand that was gripping the desk to\n",
      "death, and gently placed it on the small of her back so I\n",
      "could bring her closer in a soundless order . She obeyed and\n",
      "licked her lips, eyes still closed, face slightly tilted up.\n",
      "“Let me know if it gets worse,” I whispered again st her\n",
      "lips, and she nodded quickly . “Relax.” My voice was even\n",
      "lower this time, and her hand tightened on my shoulder ,\n",
      "ﬁngers digging into my shirt.\n",
      "There was only a breath separating us, and her\n",
      "breathing was already too loud. I kissed the edge of her lips\n",
      "ﬁrst. They parted and the tip of her tongue swiped the\n",
      "bottom one. I released a breath. I was in so much trouble.\n",
      "Impatient, I took her upper lip between mine and slid\n",
      "my tongue in, gently licking and sucking, getting\n",
      "reacquainted with her mouth. She took a step forward and\n",
      "fell into my chest. I ﬁsted her t-shirt in my ﬁngers and sat\n",
      "up straighter , my dick already straining in my pants as I\n",
      "pushed my chest against her. There was no doubt she could\n",
      "feel it. Her mouth opened wider  with a wild moan, and I tilted\n",
      "my head to the right as she went for the left, the kiss\n",
      "becoming something more in just a quick second. I brought\n",
      "my hand up to her neck, feeling her skin against mine, her\n",
      "pulse wild just under my ﬁngertips. I pushed in and took as\n",
      "much as I could from her, thirsty for more, for everything I\n",
      "could take from her. I wanted her to drown in me like she’d\n",
      "never drown ed in someone else before. If I had thought it\n",
      "was the right time, I would’ve planted her ass right on my\n",
      "desk and fucked her until she couldn’t take it anymore.\n",
      "Her hand slid from my shoulder around my neck, and\n",
      "her ﬁngers grabbed hold of my hair, her other hand\n",
      "gripping my bicep. I didn’t think she realized what she was\n",
      "doing or the fact that she was moaning and melting into\n",
      "me, pressing and pulling  at the same time as I took her\n",
      "mouth ruthle ssly. I’d been so hungry for her touch and\n",
      "taste.\n",
      "The more I demanded she give me, the quicke r she\n",
      "responded with more. Maybe this marriage thing hadn’t\n",
      "been the worst idea I’d ever had. Maybe things would work\n",
      "out just ﬁne.\n",
      "We were both reaching the point where we’d need to\n",
      "take a breath , but I wasn ’t sure I could let go. She abruptly\n",
      "pulled back, deciding for me as she let my hair go and\n",
      "rested both her palms against my chest. We were still\n",
      "standing close enough to breathe in each other’s air, our\n",
      "heads tucked  in together , still close enough for me to go for\n",
      "her lips and pull her back into the kiss so she wouldn’t have\n",
      "time to think about it.\n",
      "“Yeah.” She cleared her throat. “That was better , I\n",
      "think,” she croaked, her chest rising and falling rapidly as\n",
      "her breasts and hardened nipples rubbed against me with\n",
      "each and every breath. I was seconds away from lifting her\n",
      "up onto my desk and taking her little fake experiment\n",
      "further . “You want to try again?” I asked, my own voice just as\n",
      "rough as hers had sounde d. I used my thumb to caress her\n",
      "jawline.\n",
      "“Uhh…” She swallowed and unfortunately remembered\n",
      "that she was touching me. She took a healthy step back,\n",
      "causing me to reluctantly let go of the back of her t-shirt. “I\n",
      "think we’ve got it down now. We should be ﬁne, I think. I’m\n",
      "guessing, I mean.”\n",
      "I shove d my hands back into my pockets so I wouldn’t\n",
      "grab her and pull her back against me, starting something\n",
      "we would have even more trouble stopping. I noticed her\n",
      "eyes drop down to my waist, where she could clearly see\n",
      "my outline, and then she was backing away . I had to lock\n",
      "my body to stop myself from tracing her steps and asking\n",
      "for another go .\n",
      "She cleared her throat. “I have to wake up early\n",
      "tomorrow , so I’m going to try to get some more sleep. You\n",
      "staying up late?”\n",
      "I forced my body to relax and straightened, walking\n",
      "behind my desk. I sat down. It was the only way I could\n",
      "stop myself from going after her . I opened my laptop.\n",
      "“I’ll come up as soon as I’m done here.”\n",
      "“I’ll see you tomorrow , right?”\n",
      "I looke d up from the screen and into her glazed eyes.\n",
      "Yes, she’d see me the next day, and hopefully every day\n",
      "after that. I was going to make sure we ﬁnished what we’d\n",
      "started soon enough. I was going to do everything in my\n",
      "power to make sure she wouldn’t want to let go of me. The\n",
      "guilt I had for deceiving her was still there, but I would tell\n",
      "her everything when the time was right, no more holding\n",
      "back. I’d be anything and everything she would want and\n",
      "need me to be.\n",
      "“Yes, Rose,” I replied softly . “We’ll see each other\n",
      "tomorrow .”\n",
      "She nodded and, while still trying to back away without\n",
      "breaking eye contact, bumped into the ﬂoor lamp next to the door . When she winced, I stood up.\n",
      "“Are you okay?”\n",
      "Her hand shot up. “No, sit. I’m ﬁne.”\n",
      "“You sure?”\n",
      "“Yes. Yes, I’m ﬁne. I’ve bugged you enough, so you just\n",
      "get back to work.”\n",
      "“You could never bug me, Rose.”\n",
      "She froze then laughed, and for the ﬁrst time, it seemed\n",
      "forced and tight. Her eyelids drooped and she glanced at\n",
      "the ﬂoor. Pushing her hand behind her back, she moved it\n",
      "around until she was able to grasp the door handle and\n",
      "open it. Eyes on me, she backed out of my room.\n",
      "“Nice touch—a very husbandly thing to say. So, good\n",
      "night then.”\n",
      "“Sweet dreams,” I said, and she hesitated as she was\n",
      "closing the door .\n",
      "“What did you say?”\n",
      "“Sweet dreams.”\n",
      "“That might be a very, very bad idea, so let’s all have\n",
      "normal dreams instead—normal and alone dreams.”\n",
      "I tilted my head and narrowed my eyes, studyin g her\n",
      "expression. “ You sure you’re okay?”\n",
      "“Perfect. A little ﬂustered, actually , because kissing you\n",
      "is a little weird, so excuse my weird behavior .”\n",
      "I raised an eyebrow , confused. “Kissing me is weird?”\n",
      "“Yeah. You know , you’re my husband, blah blah blah, but\n",
      "also you’re not, blah blah blah.” Sniﬀing, she gasped and\n",
      "suddenly tilted her head back. “I’m going to sneeze. Okay .\n",
      "Bye.” She slammed the door shut, leaving me staring after\n",
      "her, confused.\n",
      "I crossed the room and opened the door, listening to her\n",
      "running up the stairs and then hearing another door slam\n",
      "shut.\n",

      "For a second there, I thought I had felt his erection\n",

      "and pulled me in closer . I had encountered them in the wild\n",

      "in the beginning. I hardly  did the ‘talking to mysel f as Jack’\n",

      "actually was attractive when you took a long look at him,\n",
      "not in the sense that Jack was attractive, but in a more…\n",
      "diﬀerent way. He looked more like a French guy without\n",
      "the romantic  and charming part. His brown hair was curly\n",
      "and fell over his forehead , and you could see the edges of\n",
      "the tattoos on his strong arms curling under his shirt. He\n",

      "I laughed, feeling all happy from head to toe. “He\n",
      "doesn’t like it when people think he is cute, but yeah, I\n",
      "wholeheartedly agree.” Still smiling, I looked around the\n",
      "coﬀee shop. Some of the roses he had brought in the\n",
      "previous week were still going strong, but I had switched\n",
      "the ones that had started fading with fake ones just half an\n",
      "hour earlier . I was going to switch them all out for the fresh\n",
      "ones.\n",
      "“Do you want me to help?” Sally asked, leaning in to\n",
      "smell the roses.\n",
      "I didn’t know why I was feeling protective, but I wanted\n",
      "to handle the roses myself and only barely stopped myself\n",
      "from snatching them away from her nose. As stupid as it\n",
      "sounded, I tried not to think about it too much. They were\n",

      "welcome our ﬁrst customers.\n",
      "Not wanting to wait any longer , I quickly typed a text.\n",

      "Rose:  The ﬂowers. I still can’t stop smiling.\n",

      "week more.\n",
      "Jack:  Did they mess up the order again? I’ll call them.\n",
      "Rose:  No! W ait.\n",
      "Rose:  They didn’t mess it up. It’s just that…last week you\n",
      "brought them in yourself , and that was more…something, I\n",
      "guess.\n",

      "end well.\n",
      "Jack:  I see.\n",
      "I see.  That was all he gave me. I took a deep breath and\n",
      "slowly let it out. Rose:  Will you drop by before work? I make good free\n",
      "coﬀee.\n",
      "Jack:  I’m afraid I’m already at work. W e have an early\n",
      "meeting.\n",

      "I’ll shut up. Hope you have a good day . Again, thank you for\n",
      "the ﬂowers. They’re beautiful.\n",
      "I hit myself on the forehead with the side of my phone a\n",
      "few times. I needed to get it together . I was not in love with\n",
      "Jack Hawthorne, and he was most deﬁnitely not in love\n",
      "with me either . It had just been a very, very convincing\n",
      "dream and kiss and touch and…that was it. Also, I just\n",
      "found him attractive—any woman would. That wasn’t a\n",
      "crime. Deep down, as prickly and cold as he seemed, he\n",
      "was actually a very good person.\n",
      "Just as I was getting up to ﬁnally unlock the front door,\n",
      "my phone buzzed in my hand with another text. Glancing at\n",
      "the screen as I was walking, my heart soared when I saw\n",

      "you oﬀered me free coﬀee. Am I assuming…\n",
      "He was ﬂirting back. As unbelievable as that sounded, I\n",
      "still hoped.\n",
      "Finding it—him—stupidly charming, I quickly wrote\n",
      "back. Rose:  I mean, you’re my husband, so I think I’m bound to\n",
      "look at you. Thankfully you’re not too bad-looking, so I\n",
      "wouldn’t cover my eyes if you showed up.\n",
      "The second I pressed send, I wanted to take it back,\n",
      "delete it, and write something more…smart and witty, but it\n",
      "was too late.\n",
      "“Hey , again,  earth to Rose. Can you hear me?” Sally\n",

      "I looke d up in surprise and only then noticed the two\n",

      "ignore it and chatted with the customers.\n",
      "When the last customer in line left, Sally and I looked\n",
      "around the place. Some were on their laptops, some just\n",
      "chatting with their friends. One person was reading a book\n",
      "they had picked up from the bookcase, and nine tables\n",
      "were already full.\n",
      "“This is a great start to the week,” Sally commented\n",
      "while wiping down the counter .\n",
      "“It is, isn’t it? I think we’re doing very well. Oh, by the\n",
      "way, I forgot to tell you—I have a doctor’s appointment at\n",

      "talking abou t?” My frown deepening, I looked down at my\n",
      "stomach. “Do I look pregnant or something?”\n",
      "“No, you don’t look pregnant at all. My mistake. With\n",
      "that husband of yours you could get pregnant just by him\n",
      "looking at you, so I’d say watch out.”\n",
      "I just stared at her in something close to horror , and she\n",
      "laughed.\n",
      "“Fine. Pretend I didn’t say anything. Of course I’ll\n",
      "handle it. The lunch rush will be over by the time you leave\n",
      "so we’ll be ﬁne until you come back. Everything all right?\n",
      "Still the cold?”\n",
      "“Yeah.” I gingerly touched my nose, glad it wasn’t  runny\n",
      "at the moment. But it had been when I ﬁrst woke up. “I\n",

      "throat when I was twenty-years-old, and I’d ended up at the\n",
      "emergency room. As it turned out, I was allergic to\n",
      "penicillin. Giving my blood was a whole other…experience.\n",
      "To say I didn’t like needles, doctors or hospitals of any kind\n",
      "would be an understatem ent. Because of all that, I could do\n",
      "nothing but feel dizzy , thinking the worst.\n",
      "As to why I was standing in front of Jack’s building near\n",
      "Bryant Park, I didn’t have a straight answer for that. I\n",
      "walked throu gh security , got in the elevator with six other\n",
      "people, and got oﬀ on Jack’s ﬂoor. I walked up to the\n",
      "blonde-haired, blue-eyed  receptionist, the same  one I’d\n",
      "seen the only two times I’d been there.\n",
      "“Hi. I wanted to see Jack?”\n",
      "“Hello, Mrs. Hawthorne. You don’t have to stop here—\n",
      "you can go straight to his oﬀice.”\n",
      "Dazed, I nodded and thanked her. I had forgotten I was\n",
      "the wife for a second there. While heading to his oﬀice, I\n",
      "bumped into Samantha, who was walking next to two other\n",
      "suits.\n",
      "“Rose?”\n",
      "I stopped moving my legs one in front of the other . “Oh,\n",
      "hello Samantha. I’m here to see Jack.”\n",
      "Her perfectly shaped and perfectly arched eyebrows\n",
      "drew together . “Are you okay?”\n",
      "I held on to the bag on my shoulder tighter . “Yes. Good.\n",
      "Thank you. Do you think Jack will be in his oﬀice?”\n",
      "“I think he is out, actual ly, but check with Cynthia and\n",
      "she’ll let you know .” The two suits kept talking and walking\n",
      "without her so she glanced at them over her shoulder then\n",
      "faced me again. “Are you sure you’re okay? You look a little\n",
      "pale.”\n",
      "Surprised that she sounded genuine, I forced a smile\n",
      "onto my face. “Oh, yeah. Just a little sick. It was nice to see you again.” Without waiting for another question, I walked\n",
      "toward Jack’ s oﬀice, taking the left turn at the end of the\n",
      "hall. Cynthia  was on a call so I cast a quick glance  into the\n",
      "oﬀice as I got closer; it didn’t look like Jack was in there.\n",
      "“Hello, Rose.  How nice to see you here.” Cynthia’s voice\n",
      "made me turn back to her .\n",
      "“Hey , Cynthi a. I just needed a few minutes with Jack. Is\n",
      "he around?”\n",
      "“He had a lunch meetin g with a client.” She looked\n",
      "down at her wrist, checking the time. “Did he know you\n",
      "were coming?”\n",
      "“Oh, no. I just dropped by. I need to head back to work\n",
      "soon. If you think he’ll be much longer , I can just leave. I’ll\n",
      "catch him tonight.”\n",
      "“He should be here in ﬁve or ten. You can wait in his\n",
      "oﬀice. Would you like me to bring you some tea or coﬀee\n",
      "while you’re waiting?”\n",
      "I shook  my head and managed to oﬀer her a small smile.\n",
      "“I’m good. Thank you.”\n",
      "When she pushed the heavy glass door open for me, I\n",
      "walked straight toward the two comfortable chairs in front\n",
      "of his meticulously organized desk and sat down.\n",
      "When I looked back, Cynthia was gone.\n",
      "Having a moment to myself, I grabbed a clean Kleenex\n",
      "from my bag and, holding  it tightly in my hand, leaned back\n",
      "and closed my eyes, trying to calm myself down and give\n",
      "my wildly imaginative mind a break.\n",
      "I couldn’t believe this was happening. I didn’t even know\n",
      "how many minutes had passed when the oﬀice door behind\n",
      "me opened and I looked over my shoulder . I wasn’t sure\n",
      "how or what I was feeling when Jack’s head lifted  up from\n",
      "the phone in his hand and he noticed I was waiting there.\n",
      "“Rose?” His brows snapped together in confusion as he\n",
      "paused with one foot through the doorway . “What are you\n",
      "doing here?” I lifted my hand halfway up in a weak wave and then\n",
      "dropped it.\n",
      "Cynthia appeared behind him, a little breathless. “I’ve\n",
      "been trying to catch up with you to tell you Rose was\n",
      "waiting for you. Do you want me to call George and push\n",
      "back that meeting?”\n",
      "“Oh, no. Please don’t,” I cut in, standing up before he\n",
      "could answer  her. “I just dropped by. I don’t want to mess\n",
      "up his schedule. I’ll leave.” I bent down and collected my\n",
      "bag from the ﬂoor. Keeping my eyes down and feeling like I\n",
      "was about to break down at any second now that Jack was\n",
      "actually standing in front of me, I tried to walk past him,\n",
      "but he used his body to block me and gently gripped my\n",
      "wrist before I could do anything else.\n",
      "Jack turned his head toward Cynthia but kept his\n",
      "searching gaze on me. “Give us a few minutes before you\n",
      "do that, okay?”\n",
      "“Of course.”\n",
      "My eyes met Cynthia’s and she gave me a small  smile\n",
      "right before Jack shuﬄe d me inside and she closed the\n",
      "door on us.\n",
      "“What’s wrong?” Jack asked as soon as it was just the\n",
      "two of us in the spacious oﬀice.\n",
      "I pulled my hand away  from his warm, gentle grip,\n",
      "massaging my wrist. Any kind of touching would just cause\n",
      "me to break down faster .\n",
      "“Nothing. I just dropped  by. I should leave.” I checked\n",
      "my watch and then set my gaze on his shoulder instead of\n",
      "his eyes. “It’s pretty late. Owen is covering for me with\n",
      "Sally, but I think I should  head back so he can take oﬀ. So,\n",
      "I’m just gonna leave.”\n",
      "Despite my repetitive words, I couldn’t make a move to\n",
      "leave, and Jack wasn’t getting out of my way anyw ay. A few\n",
      "seconds later, I felt two of his ﬁngers gently tilt my chin up\n",
      "and remain there. We looked at each other for a few heartbeats. I really\n",
      "was aﬀected by the dream I’d had the night befor e. It still\n",
      "felt like there was something real between us, and it was\n",
      "quite possibly the worst time to feel the leftover eﬀects of\n",
      "being in love with him— or, more accurately , the eﬀects of\n",
      "him being in love with me.\n",
      "“Tell me what’s wrong, Rose,” he said simply , his voice\n",
      "soft and worried. “Have you been crying?”\n",
      "I winced a little then bit on the inside of my cheek as he\n",
      "waited patie ntly. “Just a little, but it’s nothing big. I just\n",
      "went to the doctor and—” My voice started breaking so I\n",
      "stopped.\n",
      "“When? Why?” He let my chin go .\n",
      "“Now . I mean I’m coming  from the doctor’s oﬀice. I had\n",
      "an appointment. I wante d to get a spray or something for\n",
      "the allergies .” I touched my nose and his gaze followed.\n",
      "“For my nose. Obviously .” I smiled, but I didn’t  think it\n",
      "reached my eyes.\n",
      "“For the cold, right?”\n",
      "Lately , I was always walking around with a Kleenex in\n",
      "my hand or had some nearby , just in case it started up\n",
      "when I wasn’t expecting it.\n",
      "“Yes, the one-day sore throat and the…um, runny nose\n",
      "and the headaches. Anyway , it doesn’t feel like a normal\n",
      "cold. I feel completely ﬁne if you don’t count the headaches\n",
      "and the nose issues, which is why I thought suddenly I’d\n",
      "become allergic to something. It’s like water dripping from\n",
      "my nose.” I let out a small groan and looked away . “Talking\n",
      "about my nose is not what I want to do with you at all.”\n",
      "He ignored my discomfort. “I never saw you have any\n",
      "problems like that other than a few times.”\n",
      "“That’s because it’s not dripping 24/7. Sometimes it’s\n",
      "okay if I’m standing up, but when I sit down, it starts\n",
      "dripping. Lying on my back is obviously ﬁne, and so is\n",
      "keeping my head tilted back, but sometimes when I sleep\n",
      "on my face, I wake up in the middle of the night because I can feel something trailing down and… You get the point.\n",
      "Also, when it starts up when I’m working or like when we\n",
      "were at the charity even t, I have to push a cotton ball or\n",
      "some tissue paper up there, something  so I don’t have to\n",
      "hold a tissue under my nose like this all the time.” I\n",
      "lamented my words when I had to hold the Kleenex up to\n",
      "my face again. “In any case, whatever I do, it gets drenched\n",
      "too quickly anyway .”\n",
      "“Why didn’t you tell me all of this before, Rose? Why did\n",
      "you wait?”\n",
      "“I was working, and I thought it would go away on its\n",
      "own. Plus, I don’t like doctors. Sometimes it starts up and\n",
      "doesn’t stop for hours. Sometimes it disappears after half\n",
      "an hour or so. I try my best not to tilt my head down,\n",
      "because that triggers it too. Thankfully in the mornings it’s\n",
      "slow, for some reason, so it hasn’t been a big issue when\n",
      "I’m baking, but I never know when it’s going to happen.\n",
      "Speaking of…”\n",
      "I felt it coming down again, and the Kleenex in my hand\n",
      "was done already . Holdi ng on to the chair , I slowly got\n",
      "down to my knees, my eyes looking up at the ceiling.\n",
      "Blindly , I tried to reach for my bag, but suddenly Jack was\n",
      "on his knees too, reachin g for my hands. I felt my eyes blur\n",
      "a little.\n",
      "“Can you get me a tissue , please?” I asked, keeping my\n",
      "chin up and away from his gaze.\n",
      "He let go of me and got up to leave.\n",
      "“Wait, I have some in my—”\n",
      "He walked out of his oﬀice before I could tell him I had\n",
      "some more in my bag. I stood up. He came back with a\n",
      "pretty box of Kleenex and held it out for me. I pulled one\n",
      "out and, sniﬄing, held it under my nose.\n",
      "“Are you okay?” he asked again, looking straight into my\n",
      "eyes. I nodded and tilted my head back a little more to stop\n",
      "the ﬂow a bit. Sometimes that helped. Now that I’d learned what it could be, the feeling of that warm trickle was\n",
      "freaking me out more than it had only hours earlier .\n",
      "Jack massaged his temple , walked a few steps away, and\n",
      "then came back to stand in front of me. “Okay . Okay , tell me\n",
      "what the doctor said. I’m assuming it’s not allergies from\n",
      "the look on your face.”\n",
      "“Nope. Turns  out it’s probably not allergies or a cold. He\n",
      "wants to run some tests, wants to get a CT scan and an\n",
      "MRI, but he thinks I might have cerebrospinal ﬂuid leak,\n",
      "especially because it’s only coming from one side of my\n",
      "nose.” I twisted my lips and tried my best to hold back my\n",
      "tears. His eyes studied my face, and the longer I looked\n",
      "into his gaze, the more his image started to blur .\n",
      "“Don’t do that,” he ordered, his face unreadable.\n",
      "I nodded. Given the kind of guy he was, I didn’t think\n",
      "dealing with a crying female would be his favorite thing to\n",
      "do, but even hearing his gravelly voice was breaking the\n",
      "tight hold I’d had on myself ever since I left the doctor’s\n",
      "oﬀice.\n",
      "I’d put my bag on the chair as I was standing up, so I\n",
      "grabbed it and hitched it higher on my shoul der then\n",
      "nodded to myself . Tightening my ﬁngers around the\n",
      "Kleenex in my grasp, I dropped my hand down. “I should\n",
      "leave, really . I should’ve gone straight back to work in the\n",
      "ﬁrst place. I just thought I’d drop by and tell you I might\n",
      "not be able to join you—” When the ﬁrst tear slowly slid\n",
      "down my cheek, I angrily swiped at it with the back of my\n",
      "hand. “I might not be able to join you at events for a while.\n",
      "I think they need to do surgery so I’m not sure if I’m\n",
      "gonna…”\n",
      "He looked at me for a long time as the tears I had\n",
      "promised myself I wouldn’t shed started to come more\n",
      "rapidly after the word surgery . Then I felt the now familiar\n",
      "feeling that something was running down my nose, so I\n",
      "quickly tilted my head back. The last thing—the very last\n",
      "thing I wanted was for him to actually see something coming down  my nose. I felt like I couldn’t come back from\n",
      "that.\n",
      "“Okay .” He rubbed the bridge of his nose, his cool\n",
      "demeanor cracking just slightly in front of my eyes. “Okay .\n",
      "Let’s just sit the fuck down for a second.” It was the ﬁrst\n",
      "time I’d heard him curse. “And stop saying you need to\n",
      "leave. Y ou’re not going anywhere.”\n",
      "I nodd ed as much as I could with my head tilted back,\n",
      "because what else could I have done? I didn’t want to\n",
      "interrupt him at his oﬀice, but I didn’t have it in me to\n",
      "leave either . As I turned around to head back for the chairs,\n",
      "he stopped me with one hand on my arm and opened the\n",
      "oﬀice door again with the other one.\n",
      "“Cynthia, call George and tell him I won’t make it. Send\n",
      "him the junior associate I worked with—she should have\n",
      "the details he needs. I’ll get back to him later .”\n",
      "“Jack,” I broke in as he closed the door without even\n",
      "waiting to hear Cynthia’s  answer . “I don’t want to keep you\n",
      "from your work.”\n",
      "“What did I just tell you?” He pulled me toward the\n",
      "couch that was next to the ﬂoor-to-ceiling windows and sat\n",
      "right next to me. He was still holding the Kleenex box in his\n",
      "hand. I didn’t know why I focused on that so much, but him\n",
      "holding that box along with the intense and slightly scary\n",
      "expression on his face while wearing one of his many\n",
      "expensive suits would always be a good memor y for me\n",
      "after this whole marriage business was over .\n",
      "“I don’t think I know how to do this.”\n",
      "“Do what?”\n",
      "“Rely on someone. Lean  on someone. I feel like I’m\n",

      "one but each other . You’ll lean on me and I’ll do the same.\n",
      "We’ll learn how . We’re in this together .”\n",
      "I was speechless. “Now tell me what the hell a cerebro…”\n",
      "“Cerebrospinal leak,” I ﬁnished for him.\n",
      "“Whatever the hell it is. Tell me what needs to be done.\n",
      "How did it happen? When are you scheduled for the MRI\n",
      "and CT scan? T ell me everything, Rose.”\n",
      "I managed to stop the tears, but my nose was still\n",
      "leaking. “Can you give me another tissue, please?”\n",
      "He pulled another one out and handed it to me. I\n",
      "mumbled a thank you and quickly held it under my nose as\n",
      "I pushed the used one into my bag. There were more than a\n",
      "few like it in there already . He turned his body so he was\n",
      "sitting on the edge of the leather couch, his knee pushing\n",
      "at the side of my thigh, and then he ﬁnally placed the box\n",
      "on the glass square table in front of us. Sniﬄing , I wiped\n",
      "my nose and held it in place.\n",
      "“Are you sure you’re feeling okay?”\n",

      "“So, I went in and told him what was happening, and he\n",
      "just looked into my nose and then my throat because I said\n",
      "I had a sore throat a week or so ago, but now I think that’s\n",
      "totally unrelated. Then he asked me if I’ve been in an\n",
      "accident recently or had any kind of surgery , a head\n",
      "trauma, a hard hit to the head. I haven’t, and I told him\n",
      "that. Then he asked about the taste of the liquid and I told\n",
      "him I had no idea because I didn’t taste it, obviously . I was\n",
      "ﬁne at the doctor’s oﬀice so I couldn’t show him, but I told\n",

      "I blew out a breath and swallowed. “He wouldn’t tell me\n",
      "much, said he wanted to schedule an MRI and a CT scan\n",
      "right away to make sure, but I kept asking, and apparently the CSF—cerebrospinal ﬂuid—leak occurs when there is a\n",
      "hole or tear in the memb rane that surrounds and cushions\n",
      "the brain. Apparently it can be around the spinal cord too.\n",
      "Ah, anyway…so the ﬂuid, just a clear liquid , in the\n",
      "membrane protecting the brain starts leaking through the\n",
      "nose. Since I didn’t have  a head trauma, I don’t know how\n",
      "it happened.” My eyes started watering again. “And I feel\n",
      "so icky just talking about this. I was sure it was allergies\n",
      "even though I’ve never had them before.”\n",
      "“And he is sure this is CSF?”\n",
      "I shook my head. “No, that’s why he wanted to schedule\n",

      "where the leak is coming from, if there is a hole, and things\n",
      "like that.”\n",
      "“When are you going in for the scans?”\n",
      "This was the bad part, or the worse part. I winced. “I\n",
      "didn’t schedu le them.” My nose seemed to take a break so I\n",
      "rested my hands in my lap.\n",
      "His forehead creased. “What do you mean you didn’t\n",
      "schedule them?”\n",
      "“A CT scan, I can do, Jack. I googled it and it’s only a\n",

      "“What’s wrong?” His hand curled around my wrist\n",
      "again, stopping me.\n",
      "“Nothing,” I said, my tone a little harsher than\n",
      "necessary . “I need to leave. I’m already late.” “Hey .” Dropp ing my wrist, he covered my cheek with his\n",

      "who couldn’t handle kindness when I was already teetering\n",
      "on the edge, and the gentle tone of his voice was the worst\n",

      "“I asked if you’re going to die.” He pulled his hand  away\n",
      "from me and dropped it to his side. “Is it something like\n",
      "cancer?” he continued. “Did the doctor say anything like\n",
      "that? Is it not treatable? If that’s the case, let’s sit down\n",
      "and cry together and break things.”\n",
      "I just kept blinking up at him, drawing a blank as to how\n",
      "to respond. A few seconds later, I just burst into laughter . I\n",
      "was aware that it probably looked like I was losing it in\n",
      "front of him, but it couldn’t have been further from the\n",

      "think this might be why I found myself in front of your\n",
      "building, because I probably knew you wouldn’t cuddle me\n",
      "and allow self-pity. If I’d called any of my friends  or gone\n",
      "straight to the coﬀee shop, I would have just felt sorry for\n",
      "myself the entire day .”\n",
      "When his expression didn’t lighten up, I decided to go\n",
      "ahead and answer his question.\n",
      "“No, I don’t think I’m going to die. I hope not, at least.\n",
      "He didn’t say it was anything that bad—if I have what he\n",
      "thinks I have, that is. There is always the possibility of ending up having surgery  and dying on the table, but then\n",
      "again he might have skipped that part because I don’t think\n",
      "it’d be a very positive thing to tell a patient.”\n",
      "Jack tilted his head and gave me an impressively\n",
      "exasperated look. “How about we don’t jump to any\n",
      "conclusions yet? We don’t know whether it is CSF or\n",
      "something else. Let’s see the ENT specialist tomorrow and\n",
      "then start to worry about tests and scans and surgeries.”\n",
      "I nodded and took a deep , deep breath, having gotten a\n",
      "better handle on my emotions thanks to his brand of tough\n",
      "love. “I’m not good with doctors,” I told him, repeating my\n",
      "earlier confession. “I’m not good with stuﬀ like this.”\n",
      "“I really couldn’t tell.” His beautiful and gentle smile\n",
      "was the last straw for me, and the tears just started to roll\n",
      "down my face.\n",
      "He must’ve misunderstood my tears, because he rushed\n",
      "to explain. “You have to stop crying. I can’t take it. We’ll\n",
      "deal with it together , if it comes to it, but we’re not going to\n",
      "worry about it before we know what it is exactly . It doesn’t\n",
      "make sense to do so . Agreed?”\n",
      "“Now you smile at me?” I blurted out, ignoring his\n",

      "to ﬁll with tears, but I managed to hit him on his chest\n",
      "once, lightly . “Now?” I didn’t even realize my voice was\n",
      "rising, but I felt his entire  demeanor change as he kept my\n",
      "hand against  his chest and pulled me in closer , which only\n",
      "made things worse.\n",
      "I reste d my forehead against his chest, near his heart,\n",
      "and tried to get myself together . When his deeply\n",
      "masculine scent started to mess with me, I grabbed the\n",
      "lapel of his jacket in my ﬁst and pulled back so I could look\n",
      "up at him.\n",
      "“This is the worst timing, Jack. If it really is brain, spinal\n",
      "cord ﬂuid leak, or whatever the hell it is, he said I’d need to\n",
      "have surgery . I’m afraid of needles! Needles, for God’s\n",
      "sake. Surger y? And that close to my brain or spinal cord?” I took a breath and continu ed. “I know this is going  to sound\n",
      "extremely vain and I hate myself for it, but does this mean\n",
      "they’re gonn a cut my hair oﬀ? Go in through my skull? How\n",
      "would it even work? I was going to google it on my way\n",
      "over here, but I couldn’t even manage that.”\n",
      "Both his hands went up to my cheeks this time as he\n",
      "cleared my rapidly falling  tears with his thumbs. “We’re not\n",

      "what’s going  on. I told you this already and you’re not\n",
      "hearing me.”\n",
      "“I just know it’s CSF.” I stared into his eyes. “With my\n",
      "luck, I know it is.” To have something to hold on to or\n",
      "maybe because I wanted to keep him connected to me as\n",
      "long as I could, I lifted my hands and placed them over\n",

      "if I have to have surgery . We just opened.”\n",
      "He took a step closer and I released my hold on his\n",
      "wrists. “Who is talking about closing? You have employees\n",
      "—they can take care of it. If not, we’ll hire someone else to\n",
      "help. Are you even listen ing to what I’m saying? We don’t\n",
      "know what’s going on yet, Rose. Let’s see what they say\n",
      "tomorrow and we’ll start thinking about the coﬀee shop\n",
      "then.”\n",
      "My breath hitched as I managed a small nod with his\n",
      "hands on my cheeks. I must’ve looked like a mess, and I\n",
      "knew I felt like one. I tried my best to stop being stupid and\n",
      "listen to him, but my heart was clenching and I was\n",
      "starting to have trouble breathing. I forced myself to take a\n",

      "into my eyes.\n",
      "“You’re not alone in this. I’m right here, Rose. We’ll\n",
      "ﬁgure it out together . We have each other now .”\n",
      "Cue more tears, because  this Jack was too close to the\n",
      "dream Jack. As a result, I couldn’t help but lean forward and rest my forehead on his chest again. His hands fell\n",
      "from my face even as I burrowed closer , deeper into him.\n",
      "Both my arms were ﬂat against his chest yet his arms\n",
      "stayed limp at his sides. I didn’t say anything, just stood\n",
      "there and breathed in his scent, and for a good long while,\n",
      "at that. As my breathin g slowly returned to normal, he\n",
      "didn’t say anything either .\n",
      "I closed my eyes tight. If he didn’t wrap his arms around\n",
      "me in the next few seconds, I’d have to pull back and walk\n",
      "away from him, otherwise it was going to be too awkward.\n",
      "Then I felt his arms embrace me.\n",
      "“I’m right here, Rose,” he whispered, his rough voice\n",
      "washing over me like a caress that ﬁred something up\n",
      "inside me. “I might not be what you wanted or needed, but\n",
      "you got me anyway . I’m right here.”\n",
      "There was a tightness in my chest when I answered him.\n",
      "“You said that, in the beginning, said you weren’ t good at\n",
      "this kind of stuﬀ. You’re doing wonderful, Jack.” I managed\n",
      "to push myself even closer to him as his arms tightened\n",
      "around me.\n",
      "Maybe I would start to be greedy with this man.\n",
      "I didn’t know how long we stood like that, right in the\n",
      "middle of his oﬀice, but when there was a soft knock on the\n",
      "door, I reluctantly steppe d back and tried my best to wipe\n",
      "under my eyes. I could only imagine what I must look like. I\n",
      "glanced at my ﬁngers and held back a groan when I saw\n",
      "the black smudges of what was left of my mascara.\n",
      "Jack had turned halfway to glance at the newcomer so\n",
      "he couldn’t see me as I reached for a Kleenex and furiously\n",
      "started wiping at my face. The damage was done and he’d\n",
      "already seen the worst, but that didn’t mean he had to keep\n",
      "looking at it.\n",
      "When I heard Samantha’s voice asking if everything was\n",
      "all right, I quietly groaned, still hiding behind Jack’s big\n",
      "frame. “Yes. Do you need something?” Jack asked, his tone\n",
      "much more businesslike.\n",
      "“No, I saw Rose earlier and was concern—”\n",
      "“Thank you, Samantha, but I’d like to be alone with my\n",
      "wife if there is nothing else you need.”\n",
      "I paus ed the wiping as a heavy silence followed his\n",
      "words.\n",
      "“Of course,” she said tightly , and then the door gently\n",
      "closed.\n",
      "I hurri ed and pushed the Kleenex into the pocket of my\n",
      "jeans before Jack could face me again.\n",
      "“Feeling better?” he asked, eyes moving across my face.\n",
      "I hoped I was at least a normal shade of human.\n",
      "“Mhmm.”\n",
      "When he closed the distance between us with an\n",
      "unexpected smile on his face, I was surprised.\n",
      "“Why did you really come here, Rose?” he asked,\n",
      "pushing my hair away from my ruined face. “Just to tell me\n",
      "you weren’t gonna be able to attend events with me? Just\n",
      "because you knew I wouldn’t let you break down?”\n",
      "I stood still as he reache d up and his thumb started a\n",
      "gentle stroke on my cheekbone, my skin breaking out in\n",
      "goose bumps.\n",
      "I couldn’t answer a question I didn’t have a real answer\n",
      "to. “Don’t smile at me. Now is not the right time. I don’t\n",
      "want to lose my count,” I said instead, and he chuckled.\n",
      "He actually chuckled —a low, deep, manly chuckle that\n",
      "caused a slow shiver to run up my spine when coupled with\n",
      "his touch.\n",
      "“You look awful,” he said in a low voice, eyes boring into\n",
      "mine.\n",
      "I repeated the same answer I had given him the ﬁrst\n",
      "time he had paid me that speciﬁc compliment. “Thank you\n",
      "for noticing. As you know , I always try my best.”\n",
      "With his left hand, he brushed my hair back again and\n",
      "pushed it behind my ear. When he lowered his head and pressed a kiss on my forehead over my bangs, I stilled.\n",
      "“Okay , Rose,” he murmured. “Okay .”\n",
      "As I was still trying to process the aftermath of the low\n",
      "and deep sound of that chuckle and then the kiss, my eyes\n",
      "slowly widen ed as he leaned down farther and pressed a\n",
      "soft kiss on my tear-wet lips. My eyes closed on their own\n",
      "and my lips parted—partly in shock, partly because the\n",
      "response was automatic. He didn’t kiss me like he had the\n",
      "night before, didn’t leave  me feeling hungry for more, but\n",
      "as soon as he had the opportunity , he molded  our lips\n",
      "together and kissed me longer , gentle and soft. I tilted my\n",
      "head up, my heart hamm ering in my chest, and returned\n",
      "his slow kiss. As we kept going and the kiss became more\n",
      "than just gentle, bit by bit, I started to rise up on my toes to\n",
      "deepen it.\n",
      "My hands found his wrists again because I needed to\n",
      "feel anchored to something—that something being him,\n",
      "speciﬁcally . When I felt him pull away , I reluctantly pried\n",
      "my hands oﬀ. Biting down on my lips, I swallowe d down a\n",
      "protest and, with a little trouble, managed to ﬂutter my\n",
      "eyes open.\n",
      "“Is someone watching?” The question was nothing more\n",
      "than a whisper falling from my lips.\n",
      "Eyes intently on mine, he shook his head.\n",
      "I swallowed,  not sure if I wanted to hear the answer to\n",
      "the question I was about to ask. “Then why—”\n",
      "“Are you free for dinner tonight?”\n",
      "“What?” I asked, frownin g up at him, the fog his kiss\n",
      "had caused slowly dissip ating. I was having just a little\n",
      "trouble following, that was all.\n",
      "“You never answered my text.”\n",
      "His… Oh.\n",
      "“We got busy and then I…Jack, I don’t think I’d be good\n",

      "“It’d be just the two of us.”\n",
      "“It’s not a…work dinner?” “No.”\n",
      "“Then I’d rather get some takeout as usual or actually\n",

      "dealing with me.”\n",
      "“Our apartment. Stop calling it mine. And I’d like to take\n",
      "you out, Rose. We’ve done takeout enough. If you’re not\n",
      "feeling up to it tonight, tomorrow then?”\n",
      "My brows drew together as I tried to understand what\n",
      "he was saying. “You…uh , you don’t mean as in a date,\n",
      "right?” I laughed nervously , searching pretty hard for an\n",
      "answer in his eyes and maybe hoping he said he did mean\n",
      "it that way .\n",
      "He gave me his ﬁfth smile and I got distracted.\n",

      "I wasn ’t exactly sure what to say or what to think.\n",
      "Frozen in place, I just kept staring up at him. “I mean…” I\n",
      "mumbled, taking a step back. “Like a real-life date?”\n",
      "He looked at me for a long beat, and I realized the smile\n",
      "on his face had disappeared. His expression was back to\n",
      "being unread able. “If I read things wrong and you’re not\n",
      "interested…”\n",
      "“No. No. No.” I was. I really , really was. “I just… Do you\n",
      "think that would be a good idea?”\n",
      "He arched an eyebrow . “Who cares whether it’s a good\n",
      "idea or not?” That was not an answer I expected to hear\n",
      "from a guy like Jack. “It’s dinner , Rose. Say yes. Takeout or\n",
      "a restaurant,  nothing much changes. We can just try, and if\n",
      "you think—”\n",
      "“Okay ,” I blurted out before he could say more.\n",
      "“Okay?”\n",
      "I gave him a nod. “ Yeah. Y es. Okay .”\n",
      "He opened his mouth, but my nose had had enough of a\n",
      "break. I instantly tilted my head back, eyes on the ceiling,\n",
      "and my hand  latched onto his arm. “Jack—Jack! It’s coming\n",
      "again. Kleenex!” In less than three secon ds, I had another one in my\n",

      "“Thank you.”\n",
      "“Come on. I’m taking you home.”\n",
      "“What? No. I need to go back to work and forget about\n",

      "the corner of my eye as I kept my head tilted up.\n",
      "“I mean the leak, not…not everything else.”\n",
      "His gaze only softened a fraction. “Let me take you\n",

      "As sweet as that sounded, I couldn’t just sit at the\n",
      "apartment by myself with nothing to do. “I can’t. I need to\n",
      "work, Jack. I can’t sit around and obsess about what the\n",

      "“You don’t have to drop me oﬀ. I’ll take a cab—an Uber .\n",
      "It’ll be ﬁne.”\n",
      "Ignoring me, he walked over to his desk, closed the lid\n",
      "of his laptop , and picked up his phone. As I watched him,\n",
      "he made his way back to me and, to my surprise and\n",
      "delight, reached for my hand. I had to tighten my ﬁngers\n",
      "around his to keep up with his strides before we stopped in\n",
      "front of Cynthia’s desk.\n",
      "“I’m heading out. I’ll still take calls, but I won’t be here\n",

      "While we were standing at the very back of the elevator ,\n",
      "heading down to the lobby with ﬁve other people, he called\n",

      "When he pocketed his phone, I couldn’t hold it back\n",
      "anymore.\n",
      "Leaning against him, I tried to be as quiet as I possibly\n",
      "could and asked, “ Jack?”\n",

      "leaning over a small cup she was holding in her hand. She\n",
      "didn’t want me to see her like this, but I wasn’t budging\n",
      "from her side no matter what she said. So, as a result of\n",
      "that, I was watching drops of a clear liquid—which was\n",

      "drop into the cup. It’d already been twenty minutes since\n",
      "the nurse had brought us in there, and we still had at least\n",
      "another two inches to ﬁll before it reached the point where\n",
      "it’d be enough for them to test the sample.\n",
      "“If I tap the other side of my nose it comes out faster .”\n",
      "I leaned forward, resting my elbows on my thighs,\n",

      "When I realized she could  be harming herself , I caught her\n",

      "“You chose this instead of the MRI. It was either this or\n",

      "I agreed with her. I’d never seen anyone go through\n",
      "anything like this before , but I was smart enough to keep\n",
      "my mouth shut. “We don’t know that yet. You heard what\n",
      "the doctor said.”\n",
      "She shook her head from  side to side, slowly . “Actually, I\n",
      "didn’t. I just zoned out when you started asking all those\n",
      "questions.” I reached out and pushed her hair behind her ear.\n",
      "“Come on, just a little more. Then we can go.” She licked\n",
      "her lips and I noticed her eyes getting all glossy again. “If\n",
      "you start crying, I’m going to lose it and we’re going to\n",
      "have a problem.”\n",

      "her, my arm resting across her leg. “Let me hold it for you.\n",
      "Come on.”\n",
      "Her eyes met mine and I gestured to the cup with my\n",
      "head. She dropped her head forward and the ﬁrst few\n",
      "drops started coming. A few seconds later, her left hand\n",
      "curled around my wrist. At ﬁrst I thought maybe she was\n",
      "trying to line up the cup right under her nose, but when I\n",
      "looked closely , she had her eyes tightly closed and was\n",
      "biting her lip.\n",
      "I cursed myself for not being better in a situation like\n",
      "this. My family hadn’t been any better than hers. Not as\n",
      "bad maybe, but still not better. I had a family , but not really .\n",
      "I didn’t know exactly how to be there for someone  because\n",

      "didn’t mind if I crashed into everything as I tried to ﬁnd my\n",
      "way, the only thing that mattered was being there for her.\n",
      "She had me now .\n",
      "I wanted her—that was crystal clear to me. That ﬁrst\n",

      "it had been diﬀerent then. It wasn’t love at ﬁrst sight. Like\n",
      "she had said the day I proposed our business deal to her, I\n",

      "to be mine. That was it. That was everything.\n",
      "That was how it all had started, me wanting her in my\n",
      "life, and now after our fake marriage, things had started to change. It was more than I should help her out of this\n",

      "likes, dislike s, the way she reacted to the things I said. It\n",
      "was now more than just wanting to have her in my life. I\n",
      "wanted her to want  to be in my life. As much as I knew I\n",
      "was a bastard for lying to her and knew I was going to keep\n",

      "someone warm and open, and yet, selﬁsh basta rd that I\n",
      "was, I could n’t and wouldn’t think of her being with\n",
      "someone else. Cold and distant was what I’d grown up\n",
      "with, and cold and distant was what I had become . It didn’t\n",
      "bother me in any other part of my life, but with Rose, it did.\n",
      "When her hair dropped and curtained her face, I pushed\n",
      "it back again and curled  it behind her ear. Instin ctively , I\n",
      "ran the backs of my ﬁngers along her jawline,  and her\n",
      "ﬁngers tighte ned around  my wrist. My jaw clench ed, and I\n",
      "moved my hand behind her neck, trying to massage her\n",

      "contact, the more I had trouble keeping myself in check\n",

      "times we had kissed, I hadn’t gotten enough of her taste.\n",
      "She somehow left me wanting more, each and every time,\n",
      "and she was like that with everything, not just the way she\n",
      "kissed. It was even that way with her smiles. Ever since\n",
      "that ﬁrst night, this whole thing had started because I’d\n",

      "Her tight hold on my wrist hadn’t loosened a bit. “It’ll be\n",
      "over soon,” I murmured, my hand still on her neck. “My head is spinning so much,” she whispered, her\n",
      "voice barely audible.\n",
      "I could n’t help it. I slid closer to her and found myself\n",
      "pressing a lingering kiss on her temple. Her head snapped\n",
      "to the right and we lost one drop to the ground. When she\n",

      "me these last few weeks than they’d ever been. I wouldn’t\n",
      "lie and say I never wished to have a more close-knit family ,\n",
      "but wishing didn’t change anything.\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "“No speciﬁc reason. We all work a lot, and none  of us\n",

      "“Yes. She preferred that, I think, after a certain age.”\n",

      "“Just a little. Y ou’re doing great.”\n",
      "She snorted, and when more liquid came rushing down,\n",
      "her grip on me tightened. “You have no idea how weird this\n",
      "feels.”\n",
      "“I can imagine.”\n",
      "Another twenty minutes passed much the same way.\n",
      "With each passing minute after the one-hour mark, she\n",

      "“How are you doing?” I asked, my voice coming out\n",
      "gruﬀer than I wanted.\n",
      "“Not so good. I feel naus eous and I’m starting to get a\n",

      "“That’s normal. You’ve been hanging upside down for an\n",
      "hour now . Do you want to take another break?”\n",
      "As an answe r, she pushed her head up, and I had to let\n",
      "go of her neck so she could rest it on the back of the couch.\n",
      "I studied the cup as she took a few deep breaths.\n",
      "“Another ten minutes or so and you’ll be done.”\n",
      "Opening her eyes, she also examined the cup, which was\n",
      "almost three inches full. “When do you think they’ll be able\n",
      "to tell?”\n",
      "I frowned at her. “Didn’t you hear what the doctor said?”\n",
      "When she gave me a blank stare, I continued. “He’ll rush it\n",
      "for us. Thankfully they can do the test here so we’ll come\n",
      "back tomorrow and learn what’s going on.” Sniﬀing, she nodded and took the cup from me. “Your\n",
      "hand must be going numb. I’ll hold it.”\n",
      "“I’m ﬁne. I don’t mind.”\n",
      "“I know, but I do.” Closi ng her eyes, she took another\n",
      "deep breath and bent down again, making sure the cup was\n",
      "aligned correctly .\n",
      "When her left hand curled around her knee, without\n",
      "thinking I grabbed it and linked our ﬁngers together . This\n",
      "time, she didn’t look at me, and she didn’t try to pull away\n",
      "either . We just held on.\n",
      "I wasn ’t sure which one of us was holding on tighter , but\n",
      "we stayed like that for the rest of the ten minutes  and then\n",
      "ﬁnally the cup was full enough to stop.\n",
      "“Okay . Okay , Rose. It’s done.”\n",
      "She opened her eyes. “Done?”\n",
      "“Yeah.” I took the cup from her and snapped on the\n",
      "cover they had left us. I kissed the back of her hand, but\n",
      "had to let it go as I stood up. “You rest for a few minutes\n",
      "and I’ll get this to the nurse.”\n",
      "Wordlessly , she nodded and leaned back.\n",
      "It took me a few minutes to track down the nurse and\n",
      "hand the cup to her. When I got back to the room and\n",
      "gently closed  the door, Rose’s eyes opened. “Can we leave,\n",
      "Jack?”\n",
      "“I think you should sit for a few more minutes. Here,\n",
      "take a few sips of this.” I handed her the water bottle I’d\n",
      "gotten for her .\n",
      "She downed a third of the bottle. “What time is it?” she\n",
      "asked in a rough voice as she was tightening the top back\n",
      "on.\n",
      "“It’s one PM.”\n",
      "Before I could stop her, she was up on her feet, and\n",
      "almost just as quickly she swayed back and forth. “ Whoa.”\n",
      "“For fuck’s sake, sit down!” I grumbled as I caug ht her\n",
      "arms before she could fall. “You’ve been sitting with your\n",
      "head between your legs for longer than an hour. You’re not gonna get up and start running around.” I tried to soften\n",
      "my rebuke. “T ake it easy for a second. F or me at least.”\n",
      "She just kept her grip on my forearms and, as always,\n",
      "ignored what I’d just said. We had reached for each other\n",
      "at the same time. “I need  to get back. I don’t want to keep\n",
      "Owen longer than necessary .”\n",
      "“I know, and you will, but right now you need to sit your\n",
      "ass down and get well before you attempt to work for the\n",
      "rest of the day.” As much as I admired how hard she’d\n",
      "worked to get that place  up and running, this was not the\n",
      "time for her to run around and get herself even more sick.\n",
      "She looked up at me and nodded. That usual light, spark\n",
      "—call it whatever you want—was gone from her eyes. She\n",
      "looked scared and tired, and that pissed me oﬀ even more.\n",
      "I helpe d her sit down and lean back as I took my spot\n",
      "next to her and managed  to pry the water bottle out of her\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "“I was going to drink that.”\n",
      "“You’ll have it after you’ve rested enough that you can\n",
      "stay up on your own two feet and hold a water bottle at the\n",
      "same time.”\n",
      "That earned me a sideways glance that I ignored. I was\n",
      "hoping for her to snap back at me like she always did. That\n",
      "was why I always provoked her, because I loved seeing that\n",
      "heat in her eyes, but she didn’t respond, and for her, even\n",
      "that side eye had been pretty weak.\n",
      "As she was resting with her eyes closed, I leaned back\n",
      "too, my shoulder brushing hers. I ran a hand up and down\n",
      "my face, my stubble pricking my hand, having grown\n",
      "longer than what I was used to. Now, we’d have to wait\n",
      "twenty-four hours. It didn’t sound like much, but I didn’t\n",
      "know how I was even going to make it through the day yet.\n",
      "Rose leaned to her left and hesitantly rested her head\n",
      "somewhere between my shoulder and chest. My body froze\n",
      "for a quick heartbeat. When it looked like she was settled, I gently pulle d my arm away so she could get more\n",
      "comfortable and rested it on the back of the couch.\n",
      "“How do I look, Jack?” she asked.\n",
      "I couldn’t see her or her eyes, so I kept my gaze straight\n",
      "ahead on the white wall with the red poster .\n",
      "“Like death warmed over ,” I said.\n",
      "I could  hear the smile in her voice when she responded\n",
      "a few seconds later. “I can always count on you for\n",
      "compliments, can’t I?”\n",
      "“That’s why I’m here, isn’t it?”\n",
      "I wasn’t clear on how long we sat there like that, me\n",
      "breathing in her scent, but after a few minutes passed, my\n",
      "dick started stirring in my pants. It wasn’t the ﬁrst time it\n",
      "had happened around her and I was sure it wouldn’t be the\n",
      "last either, but the timing was wrong, as it always was\n",
      "when it came  to her. I didn’t know if her eyes were open or\n",
      "not, but to be safe, I rested my left arm across my lap in the\n",
      "hopes of hiding the rapidly growing hardness I knew was\n",
      "noticeable through my pants.\n",
      "When her hand came on top of mine, adding more\n",
      "weight to what was already a painful situation for me, I\n",
      "groaned and closed my eyes. I was aware of every inch of\n",
      "her that was pressing against my body, and I couldn’t\n",
      "fucking do anything in that room.\n",
      "She turned my watch enough so she could see the time\n",
      "then started playing with my wedding ring, just like I’d\n",
      "played with hers plenty of times.\n",
      "“You never took it oﬀ ,” Rose whispered.\n",
      "I closed my eyes and tried my best to ignore what I was\n",
      "feeling. No, I never took it oﬀ . Didn’t want  to take it oﬀ .\n",
      "“I’m feeling a little better . We should leave,” she said\n",
      "after a few minutes.\n",
      "When she was around, I felt like I had no control over\n",
      "myself . So, leaving worked just ﬁne for me—if she really\n",
      "felt ﬁne, that is. “Are you sure?” I felt her head move up\n",
      "and down on my chest in a nod, because her rubbing her face and scent all over me was exactly what I needed so I\n",
      "could think about nothin g but her when I was back at the\n",
      "oﬀice. “I’ll drop you at Around the Corner then I need to go\n",
      "to the oﬀice.”\n",
      "“Jack?”\n",
      "“Hmm.” Finally , she lifted  her head and looked up at me.\n",
      "With her warmth gone, I felt colder . Swallowing the lump in\n",
      "my throat, I gave myself permission to touch her, in the\n",
      "name of helping her. I pushed back her hair that would not\n",
      "stay in place behind her ear . “Listening.”\n",
      "“This wasn’t the deal.”\n",
      "My forehead creased. “ What deal?”\n",
      "“Our marriage deal,” she said slowly .\n",
      "Right. My brilliant idea. “ What about it?”\n",
      "“I’m aware that this isn’t what you signed up for. Let’s\n",
      "not fool ourselves—this is probably what they think it is.\n",
      "Two doctors,  one of them a fancy ENT specialist, think this\n",
      "is most likely CSF, so I don’t know how or when I’ll be able\n",
      "to accompan y you to your work events and dinners, but at\n",
      "least if the coﬀee shop tanks you’ll get the property faster\n",
      "and you won’t have to do the free rent—”\n",
      "“Let’s not worry about that now. I can get away with not\n",
      "attending by saying my wife is having health issues, and\n",
      "we’ll pick it up from where we left oﬀ once you get better .”\n",
      "I didn’t plan on going to any dinners, but she didn’t need to\n",
      "know that.\n",
      "She looked away from me. “Okay . I just know I’m\n",
      "breaking the rules, and if there is anything else I can do to\n",
      "make up for it, you can just—”\n",
      "I stood up and, with my back to her, quickly rearranged\n",
      "myself to hide my uncomfortable erection. I faced  her and\n",
      "met her confused gaze as I oﬀered my hand. She took it\n",
      "after a short pause.\n",
      "“We didn’t set any rules,  Rose. If necessary , we’ll make\n",
      "them along the way. Let’s just focus on your health  for now. I wouldn’t take you anyw here like this even if you wanted\n",
      "me to .”\n",
      "She got up with my help then stared at me with her\n",
      "piercing eyes, a smile breaking out on her face, which\n",
      "didn’t help what I had going on in my pants at all. I\n",
      "frowned harder .\n",
      "“I think you’re nothing but bluster sometimes, and I also\n",
      "think I might have gotten the better end of the deal by\n",
      "marrying you.”\n",
      "I arched an eyebrow at her as I opened the door to the\n",
      "hallway .\n",
      "“Come on, Jack Hawthor ne, help me end my day with a\n",
      "high. Let me count to six. Show me that smile. You can do it\n",
      "—I know you can. It’s in you.”\n",
      "I couldn’t have held back  my laughter even if I’d tried.\n",
      "Then she just kept starin g up at me as we started walking.\n",
      "She had this crooked but beautiful and expectant  smile on\n",
      "her face as she tried to keep up with my steps. That was\n",
      "what I’d wanted from day one, wasn’t it? To be on the\n",
      "receiving end of that smile?\n",
      "I would ﬁght for her when the time came. I would ﬁght\n",
      "with everything I got. “Stop grinning and walk faster . I\n",
      "can’t wait around for you the entire day—you’re making me\n",
      "late to work.”\n",
      "When we exited the building, Raymond was waiting for\n",
      "us. It took us almost an hour to get her to work, and when\n",
      "we ﬁnally made it, I walked her up to the door .\n",
      "“Looks like we have a full house,” she commented,\n",
      "staring inside before turning back to me. “So…I already\n",
      "made you late. Y ou should leave.”\n",
      "I had my hands in my pockets, my best protection\n",
      "against reaching for her . I nodded. “ Yes. I need to leave.”\n",
      "We didn’t move.\n",
      "“How are you feeling?” I asked, trying to stay longer .\n",
      "She winced and took a deep breath. “Still a little\n",
      "nauseous, to be honest, but better . The headache feels like it’s a perman ent thing now.” She gently touched her nose.\n",
      "“This stopped for the time being.”\n",
      "“When we know for sure tomorrow , you’ll feel better . Eat\n",

      "When the door opened behind her and two customers\n",

      "well.\n",
      "“They look good, don’t they? I wanted people to take\n",

      "As if I didn’t already know .\n",
      "She looked back and sent them a quick wave with a\n",
      "smile. “So you have to work from your oﬀice today , huh?”\n",
      "Did she want me to stay? If she asked, I would.\n",
      "I checked my watch.  “I rescheduled yeste rday’s\n",
      "meetings for today , so I need to get back to them.”\n",
      "“Oh, okay . Yeah. Then I shouldn’t keep you.”\n",
      "I wanted her to keep me forever .\n",
      "She pulled her hands out of her grey coat’s pockets and\n",
      "took a step forward. Placing one of her hands on my\n",
      "shoulder , she reached up and pressed a kiss on my cheek.\n",
      "“Thank you for today . It means the world to me,” she\n",
      "whispered into my ear .\n",
      "“I didn’t do anything.”\n",
      "My control, already frayed as it was, could handle\n",
      "neither her sweet kiss nor the whisper . I wrapped my arm\n",
      "around her waist and held her against my body before she\n",
      "could back away .\n",
      "Her wide eyes were staring straight into mine while she\n",
      "was still holding on to my shoulder , so I kissed her like that.\n",
      "As I held her waist tightly , I parted her lips with my tongue\n",
      "and kissed her until she slowly relaxed in my arms letting\n",
      "me have her. When I tilted my head and sucked her tongue,\n",
      "a small gasp escaped her and she closed her eyes,  pressing\n",
      "her body into mine even more. Then her tongue slid against\n",
      "mine and she turned eager. As the rush of pleasur e started\n",
      "to get too intense for an outdoor kiss as people walked by\n",
      "us, I had to slow it the hell down, but even with that, I took\n",
      "my time and kissed her swollen lips a few more times, just\n",
      "for myself, just little pecks, just to hold me over until the\n",
      "next time I could get away with tasting her .\n",
      "When her eyes opened lazily , I explained, “Your\n",
      "employees—”\n",
      "“Are watching,” she interrupted, a little out of breath\n",
      "and ﬂushed. “I guessed as much. Good kiss. You’re getting\n",
      "better and better . Practice seems to be working. No\n",
      "sighting of a turtle, but was it maybe a little bit because\n",
      "you wanted to kiss me too?” I chuckled, and her eyes dropped to my lips.\n",
      "“Yes, it wasn’t just for your employees,” I admitted,\n",
      "leaving it at that.\n",
      "It was only because I wanted to kiss her. The only thing I\n",
      "had been about to say was a reminder that she had people\n",
      "waiting.\n",
      "“Six.” It was just a soft whisper , but it was more than\n",
      "enough to stir my dick even further after our short-lived\n",
      "kiss.\n",
      "“Go inside, Rose. Try to sit down for a while before you\n",
      "jump back into everything.”\n",
      "Nodding, she turned away .\n",
      "“Don’t work too much,” I added.\n",
      "“I’ll talk to you later?” She opened the door halfway and\n",
      "looked back at me.\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "Her smile was another favorite of mine, sweet and\n",
      "happy . “Okay then.”\n",
      "When I came back to Around the Corner two hours after\n",
      "dropping her oﬀ, the smile she gave me, the one that made\n",
      "her eyes sparkle in surprise and happiness—it became\n",
      "another favorite as I guided my client to one of the corner\n",
      "tables and had my meeting, feeling Rose’s eyes on me the\n",
      "entire time.\n",
      "I hadn’t been able to stay away after all.\n",
      "THE NEXT  DAY we were sitting at the ENT’s oﬀice again as\n",
      "he gave us more information about Rose’s sickness . He said\n",
      "everything the other doctor had said to Rose before, and\n",
      "whenever I cast a quick glance her way where she was\n",
      "sitting next to me, her eyes were glazed over. I didn’t know\n",
      "how much of it she actually heard. Her hands were\n",
      "grasping the arms of the chair in a white-knuckled grip, so I didn’t think my touch would be welcome. Instead , I asked\n",
      "every single  question that came to my mind about her\n",
      "upcoming unavoidable surgery .\n",
      "“After we see the results of your MRI and the CT scan,\n",
      "we’ll schedule your surgery .”\n",
      "Rose cleared her throat and interrupted the doctor . “I’m\n",
      "sorry for interrupting you, but I’m claustrophobic— is there\n",
      "any way we can avoid the MRI scans if we alrea dy know\n",
      "from the samples that this is a CSF leak and I’m gonna\n",
      "have surgery anyway?”\n",
      "“I’m afraid not, Mrs. Hawthorne. Since you didn’t have a\n",
      "head trauma  or any other injuries that could cause a CSF\n",
      "leak, we need the MRI to see if…” The doctor’s eyes ﬂicked\n",
      "to me and then back to Rose again. “We need to see if there\n",
      "are any tumors that would create pressure on the\n",
      "membrane and ultimately cause the leak. We’ll also need to\n",
      "see where exactly the leak is. We need to know everything\n",
      "before we can go in.”\n",
      "My body tightened, my anger boiling over. A brain\n",
      "tumor?\n",
      "Rose crossed  her arms against her chest. “Can I have an\n",
      "open MRI? Is that possible?”\n",
      "“I’m afraid the speciﬁc scan we need, the open  MRIs\n",
      "can’t take.”\n",
      "“Okay , I understand.”\n",
      "“I’ll see you tomorrow and we’ll have a better game plan\n",
      "on what the next step will be.”\n",
      "Much to Rose’s and my horror , they managed to squeeze\n",
      "her in for the MRI and the CT scan as soon as we were out\n",
      "of the doctor’s oﬀice. We took the elevator down to get to\n",
      "the radiology department in complete silence. I didn’t need\n",
      "to ask her if she was okay; I already knew she wasn’t. I\n",
      "wasn’t eithe r, but I still felt the need to hear her say\n",
      "something…anything. The doors opened and we got oﬀ\n",
      "after an older couple holding hands.\n",
      "“Rose—” Her eyes slid my way and then she quickly looked down.\n",
      "“Brain tumor sounds fun, huh? That was something  I hadn’t\n",
      "thought of . Oh, there’s radiology .”\n",
      "She didn’t even give me a chance to say anything, and in\n",
      "a few minutes she was guided into a small room where the\n",
      "radiologist, a young girl with round glasses and an easy\n",
      "smile, told her to take oﬀ her shoes, bra, jewelry , and belt\n",
      "along with any metal objects and place them in the secure\n",
      "locker . When she came out after a few minutes, she looked\n",
      "paler than she had when she’d gone in. Her hair was down\n",
      "in soft waves around her, the hair tie that had been holding\n",
      "it up gone.\n",
      "I could only focus on the way her hands were trem bling.\n",
      "When she noticed it herself, she hid them behind her back.\n",
      "I tried to catch her gaze more than a few times, but it\n",
      "looked like she was purposely avoiding me. The shimmer of\n",
      "tears in her eyes was another issue, and my chest tightened\n",
      "at the sight of her trying to be brave.\n",
      "She followed the technician into the room, her steps\n",
      "faltering when she saw the tunnel-shaped machine. I\n",
      "watched as she hugged  herself with one arm and then\n",
      "quickened her steps.\n",
      "The technician was holding a weird contraption in her\n",
      "hands, waiting for Rose next to the machine.\n",
      "“You can lie down on the table now. We’ll need to place\n",
      "this on your head so we can keep it stable in the machine.”\n",
      "Rose stood still in her spot. “I…I’m a little\n",
      "claustrophobic. Is there any way we can skip that thing if I\n",
      "promise I won’t move my head?”\n",
      "“I’m sorry , but we have to use it.”\n",
      "A cage—it was a cage for her head.\n",
      "Rose nodded but didn’t make a move to get on the table.\n",
      "The technician pushed forward. “It’ll only take ﬁfteen\n",
      "minutes or so to complet e the scan, and I will be right on\n",
      "the other side of the glass.” She held up a small button\n",
      "connected to a long wire. “You’ll be holding this in your hand, and if you start to panic, you can press it and we’ll\n",
      "stop and take you out.”\n",
      "“But then we’ll have to start again, right?”\n",
      "“I’m afraid so . Ready?”\n",
      "My jaw clenched, my hands forming ﬁsts on their own. I\n",
      "didn’t like this, and Rose wasn’t moving.\n",
      "She laughed, the sound broken and wrong. “I’ll move\n",
      "any second now , promise.”\n",
      "The technician smiled.\n",
      "“Can I stay in the room with her?” I asked, the anger in\n",
      "my voice loud and clear , only I wasn’t angry at anyone\n",
      "there. I just hated that my hands were tied and no matter\n",
      "how much I wanted to, I couldn’t help her. Me staying in\n",
      "the room wouldn’t change  the fact that she was gonna have\n",
      "to go in there, but I ﬁgured it would help me, if not her .\n",
      "Rose’s head snapped up to me, her lips parting. “Jack,\n",
      "you don’t have to do that.”\n",
      "I ignored her. “Is it safe? ” I asked the technician, trying\n",
      "my best not to growl at her. I didn’t think I was that\n",
      "successful because her eyes grew large and she nervously\n",
      "reached up to push her glasses up her nose.\n",
      "“Erm, yes. It’s safe, but you’ll need to take oﬀ your—”\n",
      "“Got it.” I turned away and walked out of the room to\n",
      "take care of everything. Less than a minute later, I was\n",
      "back.\n",
      "Rose was still standing on her two feet and not on the\n",
      "table.\n",
      "“Okay?” I asked when I was standing too close yet not\n",
      "close enough.\n",
      "She took a deep breath, let it all out, and nodded. I\n",
      "oﬀered her my hand and waited as she ran her palms up\n",
      "and down her leggings and then slowly grasped  mine. It\n",
      "was cold. I helped her up, and right when she was about to\n",
      "lie down on her back, the technician stopped her .\n",
      "“Oh, I’m gonna need you to lie on your stomach.” Rose straightened up to a sitting position immed iately ,\n",
      "one of her hands still in mine, her grip as tight as possible.\n",
      "“What?” she sputtered.\n",
      "“The scan your doctor wants is taken facedown.”\n",
      "“But my nose—it’s—and… ” Her eyes came to me as her\n",
      "face started crumpling, her breathing too fast. “Jack, I\n",
      "won’t be able to breathe, not facedown. I can’t—”\n",
      "I gave Rose’s hand a squeeze and she stopped talking.\n",
      "Without shifting my eyes from hers, I addressed the\n",
      "technician. “Could you give us a moment, please?”\n",
      "Rose’s gaze followed the technician as she stepped out\n",
      "of the room and closed the door. She was on the verge of\n",
      "hyperventilating, and the scan hadn’t even started.\n",
      "“You’re going to be late to the coﬀee shop, and on top of\n",
      "that you’re making me late, too. We have to do this, right?\n",
      "You heard the doctor .”\n",
      "She swallowed, her throat moving.\n",
      "I caug ht her chin between my ﬁngers and forced her\n",
      "gaze to meet mine. Archi ng an eyebrow , I asked again, “We\n",
      "have to do this. I need you to be okay , so we can’t avoid it.”\n",
      "Licking her lips, she nodded. “I won’t be able to see\n",
      "anything. The room is closing in on me even right now .”\n",
      "Her chest was starting to rise and fall faster; she was\n",
      "seconds away from a panic attack, so I leaned down until\n",
      "we were eye level. “You can do this, Rose. You will do this,\n",
      "and then we’ll get out of here. It’ll only take ﬁfteen minutes\n",
      "—surely you can hang on that long. I’ll be here the entire\n",
      "time, and once it’s done, we won’t look back.”\n",
      "She closed the distance between us and rested her\n",
      "forehead against mine. “I know I’m being stupid. I’m sorry .\n",
      "I’m scared, that’s all. I—” She took another deep breath\n",
      "and closed her eyes. “I’m gonna have surgery , for crying\n",
      "out loud—if I freak out with this, I won’t make—”\n",
      "My left hand, the one that wasn’t in Rose’s death grip,\n",
      "clenched. “Let’s worry about this hurdle, and then we’ll start freaking  out about the surgery . Take the time to think\n",
      "about your coﬀee shop. Make plans.”\n",
      "Pulling back from me, she sniﬄed and nodded, her eyes\n",
      "suspiciously wet.\n",
      "“You ready now?” I asked.\n",
      "“You’ll really stay here?”\n",
      "“I said I would, didn’t I?”\n",
      "The edges of her lips moved up. “Yes, you did.” Another\n",
      "deep breath out. “If I didn’t worry about what you’d think\n",
      "of me, I’d try my best to run away from this right now .”\n",
      "I gave her a long look. “I can run faster than you. I’m\n",
      "calling the technician back in and we’ll get this done.”\n",
      "Another stiﬀ nod and she pulled her hand back to rest it\n",
      "on her thigh.\n",
      "I called  the technician back in and she moved to Rose’s\n",
      "left side. “ All set?”\n",
      "When Rose didn’t answer , I gave the girl a curt nod.\n",
      "“Since you were worried about the leaking, we’ll put this\n",
      "paper down under your nose so hopefully it won’t distract\n",
      "you too much. Also, it’s going to be loud in there , so here\n",
      "are your ear plugs. The sounds are completely normal, so\n",
      "don’t let them panic you.”\n",
      "The technician oﬀered another pair to me as Rose took\n",
      "them without a word and placed them in her ears.\n",
      "“Ready?” the girl asked, her gaze moving between mine\n",
      "and Rose’s.\n",
      "Rose cleared her throat. “ Yes.”\n",
      "She secured her head in the contraption, and I helped\n",
      "her lie down on her stom ach. Her eyes were already tightly\n",
      "closed.\n",
      "Before the technician could disappear behind the door, I\n",
      "got her attention.\n",
      "“Can I touch her?”\n",
      "“Yes, but try not to move her .”\n",
      "The door closed, and Rose and I were alone—if you\n",
      "didn’t count everyone else on the other side of the glass, that is.\n",
      "A few seconds later, the technician’s voice ﬁlled the\n",
      "room as she spoke into a mic from the other side. “Okay ,\n",
      "we’re about to start, Rose. I’ll be talking and letting you\n",
      "know how many minutes are left. Here we go .”\n",
      "Just as the machine started up, I put my hand on the\n",
      "only part of her body I could reach without pushin g my arm\n",
      "into the tunnel: her ankle. I forced myself to relax so my\n",
      "grip wouldn’t be painful, but I wasn’t sure how successful I\n",
      "was with that. At ﬁrst I could hear her erratic breathing as\n",
      "she tried to inhale and exhale in an eﬀort to calm herself\n",
      "down, but when the noises started getting louder and\n",
      "louder , I couldn’t hear anything.\n",
      "As minutes passed and I started to get more anxious by\n",
      "the second, all I could do was gently run my thum b up and\n",
      "down under the edge of her legging. I closed my eyes and\n",
      "tried to ignore the way my heart was hammering in my\n",
      "chest. I wasn’t supposed to feel this way. It was just a\n",
      "simple, painless MRI scan, but her panic had aﬀected me\n",
      "as well, and I had trouble just standing still when all I\n",
      "wanted to do was pull her out so she wouldn’t hurt and I\n",
      "wouldn’t see that scared and worried look in her eyes\n",
      "again.\n",
      "As the machine’s jackhammering sounds picked up and\n",
      "all the banging and thumping and beeping started to get to\n",
      "me, I just circled my ﬁngers around her ice-cold ankle and\n",
      "held on, hoping she was doing okay in there and hoping\n",
      "that I was waiting for her .\n",
      "“We have just a few minutes left. Y ou’re doing great.”\n",
      "“It’s almost over, Rose,” I said in a normal voice. I didn’t\n",
      "think she could hear me over the maddening sounds or\n",
      "through her ear plugs, but just in case she could, I kept\n",
      "talking to her, saying the same thing again and again. “It’s\n",
      "almost over. I’m right here. You’re almost done. I’m right\n",
      "here with you.” “And it’s done,” the girl said cheerfully through the\n",
      "speakers. “I’ll be right in to get you out.”\n",
      "The loud beating in my skull stopped and I realized the\n",
      "machine had as well. The technician opened the door and\n",
      "walked in. I let go of Rose’s ankle and clenched my hand a\n",
      "few times as I stepped back to let the technician do her job\n",
      "and get Rose out of there so I could get to her .\n",
      "The moment the table started to slide out of the\n",
      "machine, Rose started moving. Just as her head cleared the\n",
      "opening and I saw her proﬁle, my heart sank. She looked\n",
      "worse than I’d expected, and I’d expected it to be quite bad\n",
      "already . I took a step forward then stopped, clenching my\n",
      "ﬁsts at my sides. The second she could, she got up to her\n",
      "hands and knees, her eyes wide open, tears rapidly\n",
      "coursing down her cheeks in rivulets. Her entire body was\n",
      "shaking, her breathing frantic, as if she couldn’t quite\n",
      "remember how to breathe. Other than the shallow and\n",
      "harsh breathing, she wasn’t making a single sound. Sitting\n",
      "back on her heels, she started to push back the contraption\n",
      "on her head until the technician helped her and released\n",
      "her from it.\n",
      "“Give me a minute and we’ll help you down.”\n",
      "Rose didn’t listen to her. I doubt she even heard her. She\n",
      "pushed her legs out from  under her and tried to put her\n",
      "foot on the little ladder they had, but her legs didn’t hold\n",
      "her up and she stumbled. I rushed forward and caught her\n",
      "before she could fall on her face. She ﬁsted my button-up\n",
      "shirt in her hands, but with her eyes swimming with tears, I\n",
      "doubted she could even make out any of my features.\n",
      "My jaw set, I got my arm under her legs and lifted her\n",
      "oﬀ the table and into my arms. The fact that she didn’t\n",
      "protest only wound me up tighter . Her arms rounded my\n",
      "neck and she pushed her face into my neck, her tears\n",
      "running down my skin.\n",
      "Without a word to Rose or the technician, I quickly\n",
      "walked out of the room with her clinging to me and moved back into the small space where we had gotten ready . I\n",
      "closed the door behind us with my shoulder and gently sat\n",
      "down on the bench next to the wall. I stayed quiet until her\n",
      "breathing was ﬁnally on its way to getting back to normal.\n",
      "“It’s over now . Calm down.”\n",
      "Her head moved just a fraction, but she still stayed put. I\n",
      "closed my arms a little tighter around her, just holding her\n",
      "close.\n",
      "She pressed  her palm high on my chest and held it\n",
      "there. “I can’t…I can’t seem to catch my breath, Jack.”\n",
      "I closed my eyes. Her voice was scratchy , and it bugged\n",
      "the hell out of me. “You’re doing ﬁne. Just keep breathing\n",
      "and that’s enough for now .”\n",
      "Her chest moved against mine when she released a\n",
      "small snort. “That’s enough?”\n",
      "“That’s enough.”\n",
      "She burrowed in closer . “I’m sorry—for embarrassing\n",
      "you, for freaking out, for not being able to move right now\n",
      "even though  your shirt and skin are soaked with my tears\n",
      "and some brain ﬂuids.”\n",
      "My eyes still closed, I dropped my head back with a\n",
      "small thud against the wall. She was killing me.\n",
      "“I was ﬁne the ﬁrst ten minutes or so,” she whispered,\n",
      "pushing her forehead into my skin. “But then I couldn’t\n",
      "breathe. My head started  spinning like crazy and the tears\n",
      "just started coming down  on their own. I was afraid they\n",
      "were gonna stop and start it all over again, so I don’t even\n",
      "know how I stopped the shaking.”\n",
      "I kissed her temple. “ You did ﬁne and it’s done.”\n",
      "“I should get up.”\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "We didn’t move, I kissed her temple again. I couldn’t\n",
      "stop myself . She was still trembling slightly , but when a\n",
      "knock sounded on the door , she stirred in my arms.\n",
      "“Give us a second,” I called out, raising my voice only\n",
      "enough that whoever was outside could hear me. Pressing her hand on my chest, Rose pushed herself oﬀ\n",
      "of me before I was ready to let go and slowly got back up\n",
      "on her feet. Tucking her hair behind her ears, she opened\n",
      "the locker and grabbed the tissue she’d apparently left\n",
      "inside, quick ly wiping under her nose and tilting her head\n",
      "back. Holding the tissue and sniﬄing at the same time, she\n",
      "started to pull out the rest of her things. Still sitting down,\n",
      "I watched her eyes dart around, her face blotchy and wet. I\n",
      "caught sight of her blue lacy bra and rose to my feet.\n",
      "“I’ll wait for you outside.”\n",
      "As I was moving to go pick up my own thing s—my\n",
      "watch, belt, and wallet—from the desk, her voice stilled me.\n",
      "“Jack?”\n",
      "I pressed my lips together and glanced back at her over\n",
      "my shoulder , waiting for her to go on. She was standing in\n",
      "front of the locker with her socks on, hugging her bra and\n",
      "her coat to her chest. For the ﬁrst time, she really looked\n",
      "ill, not to mention lost and alone, and that image didn’t sit\n",
      "right with me. No, it pissed me the hell oﬀ .\n",
      "“This isn’t enough, I know , but thank you. Thank you for\n",
      "being here when I know you… Thank you.”\n",
      "“I didn’t do anything,” I muttered, my tone harshe r than\n",
      "I intended, before giving her a curt nod and stepp ing out of\n",
      "the room.\n",
      "When she stepped out a few minutes later, she looked\n",
      "better . She even oﬀered the technician a smile before\n",
      "walking out the door. She had licked her wounds and was\n",
      "ready for the rest. I believed that was why I was starting to\n",
      "fall for her .\n",
      "I placed my hand on the small of her back, maintaining\n",
      "whatever contact I could with her all the way to the car . THEY  HAD  SCHEDULED her surgery  for the following Tuesday\n",
      "after her eventful MRI. That one week was hell on earth for\n",
      "both of us. On Monday they needed us to come in so they\n",
      "could do the last few tests that were necessary for the\n",
      "surgery to go smoothly . An eye exam, an echocardiogram,\n",
      "and a pre-assessment with the anesthesiologist were just a\n",
      "few of the things we— she had done. Rose thought  all of it\n",
      "was fun. That was her go-to word the last few days leading\n",
      "up to the surgery , and she was laying it on thick with the\n",
      "sarcasm. F or me, it had been anything but fun.\n",
      "She was all smiles when she was working—welcoming\n",
      "the customers, laughing and joking around with Sally and\n",
      "the other one—but as soon as she closed the place down\n",
      "with me standing right next to her , she turned mute.\n",
      "She barely talked to Raymond and didn’t ask about his\n",
      "latest date, which I had gathered was her favorite  thing to\n",
      "do in the mornings and in the evenings as he drove us back\n",
      "to the apartment. She barely said hello to the doorman,\n",
      "Steve, and left me to do the talking.\n",
      "Me.\n",
      "The days after the MRI, as soon as we got home, she\n",
      "disappeared into her room, mumbling a few things that\n",
      "ended up with her saying something about having a\n",
      "headache and being tired. I believed her. I knew she was\n",
      "tired, could see she was having headaches more frequently ,\n",
      "but on Monday when we got back from the hospita l and she\n",
      "ran straight up to her room without a word, I ﬁnally\n",
      "reached my limit and couldn’t take it anymore. I wasn’t\n",
      "going to let her revert back to the way we’d been when\n",
      "she’d ﬁrst moved in.\n",
      "I’d managed to convince her to skip going to the coﬀee\n",
      "shop the day before the surgery . It would be her ﬁrst day\n",
      "oﬀ of many until she felt all right enough to get back on her\n",
      "feet.\n",
      "She looked heartbroken when I had to gently keep her\n",
      "moving toward the car with my hand on the small of her back as she kept looking back at the coﬀee shop  over her\n",
      "shoulder as if it’d be the last time she’d see it. I felt like I\n",
      "was taking her baby away from her. When she went\n",
      "straight up to her room, I let her be for the time being.\n",
      "I took oﬀ my suit jacket, rolled up my sleeves, and\n",
      "walked straight into the kitchen.\n",
      "An hour later when it was six PM and the table was\n",
      "ready , I reached for my phone and sent Rose a quick text.\n",
      "Jack:  Can you come downstairs?\n",
      "Rose:  I don’t feel so great, Jack. If it’s not anything\n",
      "important, I’d like to stay in bed.\n",
      "Other than the simple fact that I didn’t want her to be\n",
      "alone, she also hadn’t had anything to eat the entire day,\n",
      "and no matter what she said, I wouldn’t let her spend the\n",
      "next however many hours hungry . She had three hours\n",
      "before she needed to stop eating.\n",
      "Jack:  I’d really like your help with something if you could\n",
      "just come down.\n",
      "I knew  that would get her moving, because it was\n",
      "probably the ﬁrst time I’d asked for her help with anything.\n",
      "Just the curiosity alone would get to her .\n",
      "Sure enough, two minutes later, I heard her door open\n",
      "and close. Then footstep s started down the stairs and she\n",
      "came into the living room. Her hair was up in a simple\n",
      "ponytail with a few strands of her hair framing her pale\n",
      "face. She was wearing a chunky and oversized sand-colored\n",
      "sweater that fell way past her hips, and under that she had\n",
      "on what looked like simple black leggings and some cozy\n",
      "socks. Her sweater’s arms were pulled down, and in one\n",
      "hand she was grasping a tissue, something that had\n",
      "become a constant for her these last few weeks. As soon as she saw me standing next to the dining table\n",
      "with my hands shoved in my pockets, her steps slowed\n",
      "down and her eyes darted between the set table and me.\n",
      "“Jack? You need my help with something?” she asked,\n",
      "holding the tissue up to her nose and sniﬄing.\n",
      "“Yes.” I walked around her and pulled out the chair she\n",
      "was standing next to. “I need your help with ﬁnishing this\n",
      "food.”\n",
      "She glanced at me over her shoulder , ﬁdgeting. “ Jack—”\n",
      "“You haven’t eaten anything today , Rose.” I softened my\n",
      "tone and looked into her eyes. “You only have three hours\n",
      "then you won’t be able to eat or drink anything anyway . I\n",
      "don’t want to eat alone, so you’re going to eat with me.”\n",
      "She worried her lips between her teeth and nodded.\n",
      "“You’re right , I should eat something. Just give me a minute\n",
      "so I can do something about my nose.”\n",
      "Turning around in her socks with a whoosh , she hurried\n",
      "away to the bathroom.\n",
      "When she came back with a cotton ball in her nose, she\n",
      "sat down on the chair , and I helped her get closer to the\n",
      "table.\n",
      "I took my seat across from her and reached for her\n",
      "plate, only to have her grasp it midair .\n",
      "“What are you doing?” she asked.\n",
      "“I’m trying to wrestle the plate away from you.” I gave\n",
      "her plate a gentle tug and she let it go. “Tonight, you get to\n",
      "be spoiled.”\n",
      "Finally the smile that touched her lips was genuine.\n",
      "“Pity night, huh?”\n",
      "I shrugged. I wouldn’t have called it that, but if she\n",
      "wanted to think of it in those terms, keeping my mouth shut\n",
      "would be a better option. I reached for the big serving dish\n",
      "and started to pile spaghetti onto her plate.\n",
      "Rose leaned forward and reached for my hand, placing\n",
      "her ﬁngers on my wrist when I was about to go in for more spaghetti. A small smile was blooming on her face. “I think\n",
      "that’s more than enough for me, don’t you think?”\n",
      "I took anothe r look at her plate and decided it would do.\n",
      "I could always sneak more onto her plate when she was\n",
      "done. I let go of the spaghetti spoon and reache d for the\n",
      "Bolognese sauce. She tried to stop me after the second\n",
      "spoonful, but I sneaked another one in.\n",
      "When I lifted my eyes, she was smiling at me. It was a\n",
      "lot closer to what her usual smile looked like, so I started to\n",
      "relax.\n",
      "“Fresh thyme?”\n",
      "Her grin got bigger , and she nodded again.\n",
      "“I like this side of you.”\n",
      "“Which side?” I asked distractedly .\n",
      "“This domestic side. It suits you.”\n",
      "When her plate was ready , I handed it to her, and she\n",
      "had to hold it with two hands before she could put it down\n",
      "in front of her. Leaning over the food, she closed  her eyes\n",
      "and took a deep breath.\n",
      "“This smells amazing. Y ou were right, I’m starving.”\n",
      "I couldn’t take my eyes oﬀ of her even as I grabbed my\n",
      "own plate and started the same process.\n",
      "“I’m always right.”\n",
      "She arched her eyebrows  at me, her grin turning more\n",
      "playful. “Easy there. I wouldn’t say always.”\n",
      "“I would. Come on, time is ticking. Start eating.”\n",
      "“You are always bossy , though—that’s deﬁnitely true.”\n",
      "After giving her a pointed  stare, I waited for her to start,\n",
      "and she took her time, getting more comfortable in her\n",
      "chair and then ﬁnally started eating.\n",
      "After chewin g for a few seconds, she closed her eyes\n",
      "and groaned  before ﬁnally swallowing. Satisﬁed  that she\n",
      "would keep eating, I started on my own.\n",
      "“Where did you get this from? It’s incredible.”\n",
      "“Glad you like it.”\n",
      "“Is it a secret place? God! This is so good, Jack!” I kept chewing and then swallowed under her expectant\n",
      "gaze.\n",
      "“I made it. It’s not takeout.”\n",
      "She stopped with her fork a few inches away from her\n",
      "mouth and lowered it. “ You cook?”\n",
      "“Sometimes, if I have the time.”\n",
      "That earned another beautiful smile, and I decided I\n",
      "would always cook for her on Mondays, pasta or whatever\n",
      "she wanted.\n",
      "“You’re amazing.” She had started chewing but stopped.\n",
      "“Meaning, this is amazing—the pasta.”\n",
      "“I’ll cook on Mondays.”\n",
      "She swallowed, hard. “ You cook on Mondays?”\n",
      "I shook my head and reached for my water glass. “No,\n",
      "I’ll start cooking for us on Mondays. I enjoy spending time\n",
      "in the kitchen.”\n",
      "“Can I watch it? Next Monday? Or do you not like\n",
      "company? Oh, and of course if the surgery goes well and—”\n",
      "My eyes met hers. “You don’t want to ﬁnish that\n",
      "sentence. I don’t like company , but I like you. You can\n",
      "watch.”\n",
      "“Jack I believe we’re ﬂirting.”\n",
      "I grunted.\n",
      "“Every Monday , promise?”\n",
      "I looked into her eyes. “ Whenever you want, Rose.”\n",
      "“Then I should pick a day to cook, too .”\n",
      "We continued eating.\n",
      "“If your cooking is as good as your baking, I’ll be there.”\n",
      "“I enjoy cooking when it’s not just for me. Are Mondays\n",
      "gonna be pasta day?”\n",
      "“Do you want to make it pasta day?”\n",
      "She smiled, her head bobbing up and down. “I think I’d\n",
      "like that. It’ll be our ﬁrst tradition.”\n",
      "Her tone of voice had changed with her last words, so I\n",
      "looked up from my plate to ﬁnd her smiling at me. My night\n",
      "was already made. “Pasta day it is then.”\n",
      "“So, tomorrow—”\n",
      "“Nope. I don’t want to talk about tomorrow tonight, if\n",
      "that’s okay.” Slowly she put down her fork and steadied her\n",
      "eyes on me. “I’m completely aware that I’m being a\n",
      "complete—let me correct that, I have  been a complete diva\n",
      "about this whole sicknes s thing. I’m also well aware that\n",
      "compared to some illnesses, this is nothing, but my issue is\n",
      "that I’m simply scared. It’s too close to my brain for my\n",
      "liking and it’s really bothering me. I don’t like that I’ll be\n",
      "under anesthesia and I won’t know what’s going on, not\n",
      "that I would want to know  or want to be awake even if that\n",
      "was an option… I’m especially grateful that it’s going to be\n",
      "endoscopic surgery instead of cracking open my skull like\n",
      "they used to do back in the day, because that would\n",
      "probably kill me, but…I’m  still scared. I told you, I’m afraid\n",
      "of giving blood, so a surgery…” She shook her head\n",
      "vehemently . “And the timing couldn’t have been worse.”\n",
      "I parted my lips, but she stopped me from saying what\n",
      "was on my mind.\n",
      "“Like I said, tonight I want to act like tomorrow will be\n",
      "just another normal day. I just want to enjoy this amazing\n",
      "dinner you very sneakily cooked for us and then try to see\n",
      "what else I can milk out of my situation. I’ll deal with the\n",
      "rest tomorrow .”\n",
      "“We’ll deal with the rest tomorrow ,” I corrected her, and\n",
      "received a nod in response. “ What else did you want to milk\n",
      "out of your situation?” I asked, trying to look only mildly\n",
      "curious. I already knew I would do whatever it was she\n",
      "wanted to do .\n",
      "Her smile came back in full force. “I thought you’d never\n",
      "ask. So…” She scooted forward in her seat, rolling\n",
      "spaghetti onto her fork, eyes on mine. “Remember how you\n",
      "said you’d never watched You’ve Got Mail? I thought a cozy\n",
      "movie would  be perfect for tonight. It’s not a wishy-washy\n",
      "ﬁlm either . I promise you won’t be bored. Any movie that has Tom Hanks in it is amazing, and his on-screen\n",
      "chemistry with Meg Ryan is absolutely perfect. I’m sure\n",
      "you—”\n",
      "“Okay ,” I agreed, keeping  my hands ﬂat on the table and\n",
      "my eyes on her .\n",
      "“We can watch it?”\n",
      "“I said okay , didn’t I?”\n",
      "Her laughter took me by surprise, but I wasn’t against\n",
      "it.\n",
      "“Happy?” I asked, smiling back at her .\n",
      "Her gaze dropped to my lips. “Yes, Jack. Very. Thank\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "“You’re welcome. Now stop talking and keep eating.”\n",
      "She had a big smile the entire time she chattered and\n",
      "pulled me into convers ation after conversation during\n",
      "dinner . As good as I was at not showing what I was thinking\n",
      "or feeling, I wasn’t sure if I did a good job that night. I was\n",
      "too worried about what the next day would bring and what\n",
      "I would  do if something happened to her when she was out\n",
      "of my reach. WCHAPTER EIGHTEEN\n",
      "JACK\n",
      "e got up from the dining table around seven-thirty\n",
      "PM. It had been one of the longest dinners I’d ever\n",
      "had, but since Rose looked happy , I didn’t and couldn’t\n",
      "have compla ined. She insisted on getting all the dishes in\n",
      "the dishwash er, and I kept her company until she was done.\n",
      "Her smile never wavered, and it made me happy to see it.\n",
      "I prepared her some tea and made myself a cup of\n",
      "coﬀee. I had bought her some truﬄes on Friday because I\n",
      "knew her weakness for chocolate but hadn’t ended up\n",
      "ﬁnding the right moment to give them to her, so I took the\n",
      "elegant box with me and set everything up on the coﬀee\n",
      "table.\n",
      "I found  the Apple TV remote and started to search for\n",
      "the movie she was talking about. When I came upon it, I\n",
      "charged it to my account and pressed play .\n",
      "“Wait, wait.” Rose jumpe d up and ran over to get the\n",
      "lights. “That’s better .”\n",
      "She came back, sat down, and immediately pulled her\n",
      "legs under her as she reached for the big knitted blanket\n",
      "she had brought down from her room. I handed her the tea\n",
      "mug.\n",
      "She grabbed my wrist with her right one and tugged me\n",
      "down next to her . “It’s starting, sit down.” I managed to reach for my own coﬀee mug and her box\n",
      "of truﬄes.\n",
      "Feeling a little uncomfortable about it, I thrust the box\n",
      "into her hand and leaned back against the couch. When she\n",
      "glanced at me in confusio n, I focused on the movie  that had\n",
      "just begun and took a sip of my coﬀee.\n",
      "“What is this?” Balancing  her mug on the ﬂat surface of\n",
      "the couch, she sent me a quick look then started opening it.\n",
      "“Chocolate? F or me?” she asked, her voice high.\n",
      "“A client brought it on Friday , and it was just sitting in\n",
      "the oﬀice so I thought you might want it.” The lie rolled oﬀ\n",
      "my lips so easily , I surprised even myself .\n",
      "Out of the corner of my eye, I could already see her\n",
      "taking a bite out of one of them. “You want one?” she asked\n",
      "when she was done driving me crazy and moaning about it.\n",
      "She held the box toward me. “Don’t you like truﬄes? Come\n",
      "on, take one.”\n",
      "I gave her an exasperated look and took one, holding it\n",
      "in my hand. “Will you let me watch this movie or are you\n",
      "going to talk the entire time?”\n",
      "She winced. “You’re one of those. Be prepared for me to\n",
      "talk. I’ll keep pointing things out you can already see for\n",
      "yourself . I’m just excited because you’ve never seen it. Is it\n",
      "past nine?”\n",
      "I kept my eyes on the screen as Meg Ryan’s character\n",
      "started runni ng toward her laptop to check her email. “Not\n",
      "yet. I’ll tell you when you need to stop. It’s only eight.”\n",
      "We sat in silence and just watched the movie. Around\n",
      "the ten-minute mark, Meg Ryan ﬁnally made it to her shop.\n",
      "The Shop Around the Corner .\n",
      "I slung my arm across the back of the couch, toward her .\n",
      "A few minutes later, I glanced at her. The box containing\n",
      "the truﬄes looked like it had six missing ones, and she was\n",
      "still holding the tea mug tightly in her hands as if trying to\n",
      "warm them.\n",
      "“Are you cold?” “Just a little. Would you like to share?” she repeated,\n",
      "and my brows drew together .\n",
      "Then I realized she was holding the edge of the blanket\n",
      "up and away from herself .\n",
      "It wasn’t cold—the apartment was plenty warm— but I\n",
      "took the opportunity to move a little closer to her, and she\n",
      "put it over my legs. When she leaned her head back, it was\n",
      "almost resting in the crook of my arm.\n",
      "She took a deep breath and let it all out.\n",
      "Her voice was quiet when she spoke up again. “Thank\n",
      "you for tonight, Jack.”\n",
      "Leaning down, I pressed a kiss to her temple. “You’re\n",
      "very welcome, Rose.”\n",
      "At ten to nine, I took her now cold tea mug away  from\n",
      "her and put it down on the coﬀee table. A little more than\n",
      "halfway into the movie, she’d fallen asleep, and her head\n",
      "had dropped  on my shoulder . I watched the movie till the\n",
      "end without moving an inch so she could rest. The more\n",
      "she tucked herself closer , the harder it had been for me to\n",
      "not wake her up and take her mouth. It seemed like she\n",
      "had invaded the entire apartment and I could smell nothing\n",
      "but her .\n",
      "I enjoyed every second of it, both the movie and Rose’s\n",
      "warm body against mine.\n",
      "Scooping her up into my arms, I straightened up, letting\n",
      "the blanket fall oﬀ of her .\n",
      "She started coming around once we were halfway up the\n",
      "stairs.\n",
      "“Jack?” Her hands tightened around my neck. “What\n",
      "time is it?” she mumbled.\n",
      "“A little past ten.”\n",
      "Sighing, she rested her head on my shoulder .\n",
      "“Did you like the movie?”\n",
      "I didn’t have to lie. “ Yes, you were right, it was good.”\n",
      "“They don’t make movies like that anymore, ” she\n",
      "murmured. I opened the door to her room and walked in, gently\n",
      "putting her down on the bed. She curled up on her side and\n",
      "I pulled the already open covers over her .\n",
      "“Good night, Jack,” she whispered. “I’ll see you\n",

      "night, at least this night with her .\n",
      "“Good night, Rose.” I leaned down and pressed a\n",
      "lingering kiss on her forehead and then her lips. It was\n",
      "such a natural move for me that I didn’t even hesitate. She\n",
      "closed her eyes with a smile on her lips. I was pretty sure\n",
      "she had never woken up fully .\n",
      "My mind on her, I walked out and headed to my own\n",
      "room.\n",
      "Later that same night, hours had passed and I was still\n",
      "wide awake. My mind was running in all directions, but it\n",
      "was especially running in the direction of where Rose was\n",
      "sleeping a few doors down, which was why I was surprised\n",
      "when my phone pinged with a new text.\n",
      "Rose:  Are you asleep?\n",
      "Jack:  No.\n",
      "Rose:  Me neither .\n",
      "I took a deep breath, ran my hand over my face.\n",
      "Jack:  Everything okay?\n",
      "Rose:  Yes. Just can’t sleep.\n",
      "Rose:  Why are you still up?\n",
      "Jack:  Couldn’t sleep either .\n",
      "Rose:  Can I still milk my situation or did I miss my chance?\n",
      "Jack:  Depends on what you want.\n",
      "Rose:  It’s a weird one. Jack:  Try me.\n",
      "Rose:  I was wondering if I could kiss you.\n",
      "Rose:  And before you say no, it doesn’t have to mean\n",
      "anything but that, just a kiss. The truth is you’ve slowly\n",
      "become this adept kisser and I think I wouldn’t mind\n",
      "kissing you right now . I’d like to call it a pity kiss. If that’s\n",
      "not okay since no one would be around to see it, I\n",
      "understand that.\n",
      "The dots were still dancing around, but I left my phone\n",
      "on my nightstand and walked away . I chose not to knock\n",
      "and just walked into her room.\n",
      "She seemed to be still typing but stopped when she saw\n",
      "me. Clearing her throat, she got up to her knees to get out\n",
      "of bed, but I made it to her before she could.\n",
      "“How do you want to do thi—”\n",
      "I didn’t give her time to ﬁnish her sentence. In the next\n",
      "breath, I was holding her head in my hands after having\n",
      "pushed her hair back. Her cheeks were warm and slightly\n",
      "wet.\n",
      "“I don’t want you to cry anymore,” I muttered with a\n",
      "tinge of anger coloring my voice. That was the last thing I\n",
      "wanted for her. “I’ll kiss you, but only if you promise not to\n",
      "cry anymore. I can’t take it, Rose.”\n",
      "She nodded.\n",
      "I lowered my head down to hers, parted her lips with\n",
      "mine, and watched her eyes as they closed the second our\n",
      "lips touched. She place d her hands over mine on her\n",
      "cheeks and tilted her head up, deepening the kiss. I slowly\n",
      "dropped to my knees on the bed, tightened my hands\n",
      "around her face, plunging my ﬁngers into her hair as her\n",
      "arms moved between us to wrap around my neck. I pulled\n",
      "her tongue into my mouth and happily swallowed her quiet\n",
      "groan. If I had to describe our kiss, I would say it was a gentle\n",
      "violence. I couldn’t get enough of her, couldn’t get close\n",
      "enough. I let one of my hands travel down her back,\n",
      "memorizing every inch and how her body dipped at her\n",
      "waist. When  I had a good grip on her shirt, I pulled her\n",
      "ﬂush against me. She grunted but didn’t stop, didn’t ask me\n",
      "to stop.\n",
      "I could feel her chest rising and falling against mine, her\n",
      "heat burning me up already . I ﬁsted her shirt in my hand\n",
      "and deepene d the kiss, forcing her to arch her back at the\n",
      "same time, gripping her waist tightly with my other hand.\n",
      "Her head dipped back with the force of my kiss, her tongue\n",
      "playing with mine.\n",
      "Then her hands were braced on my chest and I felt a\n",
      "slight push.\n",
      "I managed to wrench myself away , and she quickly\n",
      "jumped out of my arms and the bed, running straight to the\n",
      "bathroom.\n",
      "My whole body was wound up tight. I sat down on the\n",
      "edge of the bed and dropped my head into my hands. My\n",
      "breathing was heavy , my heart beating in my throat like a\n",
      "teenager making out with his girlfriend in her house.\n",
      "While I was contemplating getting up and leaving or\n",
      "staying, Rose re-emerged from the bathroom, her face\n",
      "ﬂushed, lips red and swollen, hair all messed up.\n",
      "She looked perfect.\n",
      "She slowly made her way back, stopping in front of me\n",
      "when her knees were almost touching mine.\n",
      "I didn’t want to apologize for pouncing on her like a\n",
      "beast, but I had completely forgotten she was ill.\n",
      "“Sorry ,” she muttered, her voice thick. Her index ﬁnger\n",
      "tapped the side of her nose. “It was starting up again so I\n",
      "had to…”\n",
      "I sighed a breath of relief  and nodded. I swallowed down\n",
      "the lump in my throat and was about to get up to leave, but\n",
      "Rose put both her hands on my shoulders and climbed into my lap, not sitting, but she had put one of her legs between\n",
      "mine and was standing on her knees. My hands found\n",
      "purchase on her hips and I held her still.\n",
      "“What are you doing?” I asked in a harsh whispe r as I\n",
      "stared into her alluring eyes.\n",
      "She smiled down at me. “I’m getting the rest of my pity\n",
      "kiss,” she whispered back in a low and steady voice, much\n",
      "steadier than mine, to my surprise. “I’m not done with you\n",
      "yet.” Her hands smoothed my hair back as her eyes closed\n",
      "on their own and her head descended.\n",
      "I met her halfway and took her mouth in a deep and\n",
      "scalding kiss, giving her needy laps of my tongue as her\n",
      "ﬁngers comb ed through my hair and she gripped my neck\n",
      "to hold me up to herself . I kissed her like that for a long\n",
      "time, trying to be gentler  and more considerate than I was\n",
      "feeling, but she disarmed me. Her taste, her little moans,\n",
      "her hands tightening on my neck, her body moving\n",
      "restlessly against mine—everything about her disarmed\n",
      "me.\n",
      "When she moved her lips to the right and tried to\n",
      "breathe against my cheek, I watched all the emotions\n",
      "playing on her face. Knowing I couldn’t stop, I held her\n",
      "waist and gave her a tug so she would sit down. Her eyes\n",
      "opened and found mine. Moving her leg to straddle me, she\n",
      "wordlessly followed my lead, sitting right on my dick. My\n",
      "eyes closed and a groan escaped my lips. When I looked\n",
      "back at her, she was biting her lip, staring at me intently . I\n",
      "rounded my arms around her, letting one of my hands\n",
      "slowly slide up her back to hold her neck, and dove in for\n",
      "another kiss. I kissed her once then pulled back, then again\n",
      "and again and again. It was maddening, the way her lips ﬁt\n",
      "mine.\n",
      "With my other hand, I gripped her waist. She tilted her\n",
      "head and pushed her tongue into my mouth. I could barely\n",
      "think as it was, but I met her exploring tongue with my own and leaned forward, forcing her to arch, going deeper ,\n",
      "trying to take more and more.\n",
      "The pain and pleasure that seared through me when I\n",
      "felt her heat slide across my cock through her thin pajama\n",
      "bottoms only tripled with the way she was kissing me, so\n",
      "out of control and hungry .\n",
      "We pulled and pushed as if we were starving for each\n",
      "other . I grabbed her thighs and tried to somehow pull her\n",
      "even closer . When she rocked against me, some sense\n",
      "started to trickle back in. My hands still hard bands around\n",
      "her, she managed to pull back and, in an instant , took oﬀ\n",
      "her shirt. Her eyes glazed and her breaths coming out as\n",
      "shallow pants, she leaned toward me again, but when my\n",
      "eyes dropped to her full tits enclosed in a pale blue bra, I\n",
      "leaned back and gently deposited her on her back.\n",
      "“Jack?” she gasped, surprised.\n",
      "I made sure I wasn’t looking at her, because if I did get\n",
      "another look, I would forget myself , forget that she was\n",
      "sick, forget everything. I reached for her t-shirt and handed\n",
      "it back  to her. She held it up against her chest,  covering\n",
      "herself .\n",
      "“The doctor said no sex. You can’t have too much\n",
      "pressure in your head.” I heard my own voice, hoarse and\n",
      "raw. I dared  to meet her eyes. They were still dazed, but\n",
      "she was coming back to herself . She licked her lips and my\n",
      "stomach dropped because it wasn’t my own tongue on\n",
      "them.\n",
      "“But Jack, I—”\n",
      "“You have surgery in a few hours, Rose. I’ll wake you up\n",
      "when it’s time to leave.”\n",
      "She sobered  and quickly put her shirt back on, getting\n",
      "under the covers. “You don’t need to do that. I’ll wake up\n",
      "when it’s time.”\n",
      "“Rose—”\n",
      "“Good night, Jack. Thank you for the kiss.” I gritted my teeth and backed away . Before I could close\n",
      "her door, she’d already turned oﬀ her bedside lamp, and I\n",
      "could barely make out her form in the bed. The door\n",
      "clicked shut and I let go of the handle, leaving something\n",
      "very important to me behind. TCHAPTER NINETEEN\n",
      "ROSE\n",
      "he next morning, I woke up on my own, just as I’d said\n",
      "I woul d, and I met Jack downstairs. Maybe becau se of\n",
      "the nerves that came with the surgery or because of what\n",
      "had happene d just the night before, neither one of us said a\n",
      "word to each other .\n",
      "When Steve, the doorman, wished me good luck and told\n",
      "me he couldn ’t wait to see me again with all good news, I\n",
      "was ashame d to admit I got a little teary-eyed and only\n",
      "managed to give him a small smile and a nod. He\n",
      "understood I wasn’t trying to be rude, though; I could see it\n",
      "in his own smile. The car ride was similarly quiet. When\n",
      "Raymond pulled the car up in front of the hospital , Jack got\n",
      "out and held the door open for me. I followed after him, but\n",
      "before I could step out, Raymond’s voice stopped  me with\n",
      "one foot in the car and the other one out on the pavement.\n",
      "He slung his arm over the passenger seat and turned his\n",
      "body so he could meet my eyes. “You will be ﬁne,” he\n",
      "assured me, his voice soft and quiet. It was the second time\n",
      "I teare d up that morning. Everything else had been just\n",
      "automatic. I’d woken up, taken a very quick shower , gotten\n",
      "dressed, grabbed my hospital bag, and walked out of Jack’s\n",
      "apartment. It had almost  felt like I was just going to travel\n",
      "somewhere I didn’t necessarily want to go to .\n",
      "“Okay ,” I replied. Raymond arched his eyebrows. “You can do better than\n",
      "that.”\n",
      "“I’ll probably be ﬁne.”\n",
      "“No probably  about it. I’ll come up when you’re out of\n",
      "surgery to say hi, all right?”\n",
      "I wasn ’t sure if I wanted anyone to see me after the\n",
      "surgery , but I didn’t say that. “I’d like that. Thank you,\n",
      "Ray.”\n",
      "“See you soon.”\n",
      "“Okay . See you soon.”\n",
      "I got out and, with Jack by my side, walked into the\n",
      "hospital. I cast quick glances at him, but his face looked all\n",
      "stony , like the ﬁrst day I’d met him. I didn’t know what to\n",
      "say to him. That wasn’t true—I actually did know  what to\n",
      "say to him, but it wasn’t the time for it. After we checked in\n",
      "and they conﬁrmed our surgery time, a nurse took us up to\n",
      "a hosp ital room, apparen tly not the one I’d be staying in,\n",
      "but a diﬀerent one.\n",
      "Jack stayed in the corner with his hands in his pockets. I\n",
      "now knew what that meant: he was nervous about\n",
      "something, unhappy .\n",
      "The nurse gave me my hospital gown and asked me a\n",
      "whole lot of questions: my name, my age, my weight, the\n",
      "things I was allergic to—all things they already knew , but\n",
      "double-checking never hurt anyone. I was allergic to\n",
      "penicillin. That was the one thing I remembered I kept\n",
      "saying. She put the identiﬁcation band on me, walked me\n",
      "through what was going to happen next, and left me with\n",
      "Jack so I could change into the gown.\n",
      "I was like a robot. I went into the little bathroom and\n",
      "took oﬀ my clothes, all but my underwear , and put the\n",
      "gown on. My heart hammering in my chest, I stepp ed out of\n",
      "the bathroom and met Jack’s hard gaze.\n",
      "Spreading my arms, I tried to sound cheerful when I\n",
      "asked, “How do I look?”\n",
      "He didn’t answer , just stared into my eyes. I took a step toward him, because now was the time to\n",
      "say what I needed to say to him. The same nurse who had\n",
      "been in just a few minutes earlier popped her head through\n",
      "the doorway , and both Jack and I glanced at her .\n",
      "“Is she dressed? Oh, good, you’re ready . I’m sending\n",
      "someone in to get you in the wheelchair .”\n",
      "“I, uh, can I have just a quick minute with my husband?”\n",
      "Her eyes darted to Jack then she checked her watch.\n",
      "“Just one minute. We need to get you to the OR on time,\n",
      "okay?”\n",
      "I nodded, and she left.\n",
      "Letting out a deep, deep breath, I walked over to where\n",
      "Jack was leaning against the wall, his arms crossed against\n",
      "his chest.\n",
      "“I have some things I want to say to you,” I started,\n",
      "feeling a little sick and very small in front of him. It\n",
      "could’ve been the thin hospital gown, the surgery , nerves,\n",
      "or simply because of what I was about to tell him. I ran my\n",
      "hands up and down my arms and his eyes followed my\n",
      "movements.\n",
      "He was silent for a full minute as we took in our ﬁll of\n",
      "each other .\n",
      "“Okay ,” he ﬁnally said, looking all miserable.\n",
      "“Jack, I want us to—”\n",
      "“I’m sorry, but they need to take you now,” the nurse\n",
      "said, walking into the room with someone else trailing\n",
      "behind her with a wheelchair .\n",
      "Oh, dammit! Things just got real.\n",
      "The fear that spiked in me wasn’t much diﬀerent than\n",
      "my panic attack in the MRI machine, and I looke d back at\n",
      "Jack with fear in my eyes. I really wanted to talk to him.\n",
      "He straightened up oﬀ the wall. “We’ll need another\n",
      "minute.”\n",
      "“We’re already running behind. She—”\n",
      "Jack walked over and took the wheelchair from the other\n",
      "woman’s hands then turned to the nurse, gritting his teeth. “I need just a moment with my wife. Please.”\n",
      "A shive r worked its way through my body when I heard\n",
      "him call me his wife, which was stupid on its own, but\n",
      "coming from his mouth  with that growly tone, it was\n",
      "unexpected.\n",
      "Not so surprisingly , they left us alone with only one\n",
      "disapproving glance toward Jack. He rolled the wheelchair\n",
      "toward me and gestured with his head for me to sit down.\n",
      "If he wasn’t using words, we had problems.\n",
      "Before the nurse could come back, I rushed into my\n",
      "impromptu speech. I could already sense that it wasn’t\n",
      "going to be elegant.\n",
      "“Jack, I want to stop pretending.”\n",
      "He came around and kneeled in front of me, his hands\n",
      "resting on my thighs. His face looked a bit softer , the harsh\n",
      "scowl he had ﬂashed to the nurses not there anymore, but\n",
      "there wasn’t a smile in sight either .\n",
      "He opened his mouth, but I leaned forward and shook\n",
      "my head.\n",
      "“When I wake up from this, I want us to stop\n",
      "pretending.”\n",
      "Those beautiful blue eyes I couldn’t stop looking at\n",
      "whenever I had the chan ce bored into my ordinary brown\n",
      "ones. I had no idea how this was going to go, but we didn’t\n",
      "have much time.\n",
      "“You like me,” I continue d, and he arched an eyeb row. I\n",
      "pushed forward despite that. “You probably won’t want to\n",
      "admit this out loud, but you like me. I know it, so don’t lie\n",
      "to me, and I like you. So, Jack Hawthorne, you asked me\n",
      "out on a date, which I know got lost with everything else\n",
      "happening, but we’re still pretending, and I want us to stop\n",
      "doing that, okay?”\n",
      "He looked at me for a long moment and I started to\n",
      "think this really wasn’t going to go how I wanted it to go .\n",
      "“How do you know I like you?” “You have to. Yesterday… that kiss wasn’t just a pity kiss.\n",
      "A pity kiss would be a quick peck on the lips or just a\n",
      "minute of something a little more, maybe. Neithe r was the\n",
      "kiss in your oﬀice at home.” I shook my head. “Even if it\n",
      "wasn’t that kiss, it’s the things you do. The dinner\n",
      "yesterday , the ﬂowers you bring every week—ev erything.\n",
      "You must have started liking me at some point during the\n",
      "last two months. I’m not stupid, and I like you more and\n",
      "more with each passing day .”\n",
      "“No, you’re not stupid. Y ou like me then?”\n",
      "“Yes. So…I want to stop pretending and start…\n",
      "something real. More than just a date.” As lame as that\n",
      "sounded, I wanted that right to him. He was my husband on\n",
      "paper , but that was it. I wanted a real claim on him.\n",
      "“Okay .”\n",
      "“I—what? Okay? Just okay?”\n",
      "He smiled at me and reached up to tuck my bangs\n",
      "behind my ear. It was smile number ten or maybe twenty ,\n",
      "and it was such a good one. Hesitantly , I returned his smile,\n",
      "my heart soaring.\n",
      "“I already asked you out on a date, didn’t I? You just like\n",
      "to steal my thunder . Why do you look so surprised?”\n",
      "“You weren’t really committed to the date thing when\n",
      "you asked me out for dinner. You said we could try and see\n",
      "if there is something there. I’m being bold and saying there\n",
      "is somet hing there. I thought you’d put up a big ﬁght and\n",
      "deny liking me.”\n",
      "“Why would I do that when all I want is you? I want us\n",
      "to stop pretending too .”\n",
      "The nurse came back in with a stern face. “Time to go,\n",
      "Mrs. Hawthorne.”\n",
      "Jack’s smile melted and he glowered at the nurse who\n",
      "had taken hold of my wheelchair . He grabbed the armrests\n",
      "and pulled me toward him as the nurse tried to wheel me\n",
      "back. “Mr. Hawthorne!” she exclaimed in shock. “Let go of\n",
      "your wife, please.”\n",
      "“We’re still talking here.”\n",
      "Nervous laughter bubbled out of me as they continued\n",
      "to push and pull for a few seconds. I put my cold hand on\n",
      "his cheek, and he stilled. “It’s okay, Jack.” Leaning forward,\n",
      "I kissed his cheek and took a deep breath through my nose\n",
      "so I could keep his scent with me for as long as I could, and\n",
      "then the nurse wheeled me away .\n",
      "Jack walked with us all the way to the elevators.\n",
      "I looked up at him from my seat and he reached out to\n",
      "hold my hand. “Will you come back from work before I\n",
      "wake up, or…?”\n",
      "“Don’t be stupid. I’m not going anywhere,” he growled,\n",
      "softening his words with a squeeze around my hand. He\n",
      "was still glowering at the nurse.\n",
      "“Okay . I was just testing  you. I’d really like to see you\n",
      "when I come out.” He must have heard the tremor in my\n",
      "voice, because his eyes met mine and he lowered himself to\n",
      "my level as we waited for the elevator to get there. He\n",
      "looked so ridiculous in a hospital with his perfect suit and\n",
      "perfect face and perfect stubble. My eyes started to well up\n",
      "and he becam e a blur in front of me. Then his hands were\n",
      "cupping my face and he was wiping away my tears. He\n",
      "rested his forehead against mine.\n",
      "“Jack, I’m a little scared,  I think,” I admitted, quietly so\n",
      "only his ears could hear .\n",
      "He sighed. “I don’t know  what the right words are here\n",
      "because I’m more than a little scared, but I know you’re\n",
      "going to be ﬁne. You have  to be. It’s going to be ﬁne, Rose.\n",
      "I’ll be waitin g for you when you come out, and then it’ll be\n",
      "just us.”\n",
      "I bit my lip and let him clear more tears from my cheeks.\n",
      "“Okay .” My voice was nothing more than a croak. I looked\n",
      "down at my hands. “Oh, here.” I took oﬀ my ring and\n",
      "opened his palm, placing  my wedding ring in the middle. “Hold on to it for me.” More tears started to come down\n",
      "and I couldn’t look into his eyes.\n",
      "“Rose,” Jack started, his hands holding my face.\n",
      "The elevator  doors pinged open and there was a long\n",
      "sigh.\n",
      "“Mr. Hawthorne, please let go of your wife.”\n",
      "He did—reluctantly—right after he pressed a soft yet\n",
      "somehow still hard and desperate kiss on my lips.\n",
      "I looked at Jack over my shoulder once I was in the\n",
      "elevator and found him back up on his feet. He was so\n",
      "handsome. I tried to smile, but more tears blurred my\n",
      "vision of him.\n",
      "“I’ll be right there when you wake up, Rose. I’ll be\n",
      "waiting for you right here, so you come back to me, okay?\n",
      "Make sure you come back to me.”\n",
      "I knew I was being a baby, but I didn’t care. Pressi ng my\n",
      "lips tightly together , I nodded and the doors closed, taking\n",
      "him away from me.\n",
      "Everything after that was a big blur. I was taken down to\n",
      "the OR area. They scann ed the band on my wrist and took\n",
      "me into another waiting room where I was told to get in a\n",
      "hospital bed. More questions came that I answered\n",
      "absentmindedly . The anesthesiologists came in and again\n",
      "asked more questions. I couldn’t even tell you how many\n",
      "times I repeated my name, my birth date, my weight, my\n",
      "allergies, and which side of my nose I was leaking from,\n",
      "and I wasn’t  sure how long I was in that room before they\n",
      "took me into the operating room. When I got there, it was\n",
      "already ﬁlled with all kinds of people: the anesthesiologists,\n",
      "the surgical assistant, the nurse anesthetist, my doctor , and\n",
      "a few more people who I had no idea what they were doing\n",
      "in there.\n",
      "Smiling at me the entire time, the nurse anesthetist put\n",
      "my IV in and reassured me that everything would be okay. I\n",
      "realized I’d started cryin g again at one point, so I angrily wiped at my cheeks and tried to play it oﬀ by laughing at\n",
      "myself . She just smiled at me.\n",
      "When they secured my hands and legs, I started to get\n",
      "dizzy and my vision started to darken. I hadn’t realized that\n",
      "was going to happen. No one had told me that. I started to\n",
      "panic in earnest, my breaths coming in faster . I heard the\n",
      "nurse say she was pushing in the anesthesia, and a few\n",
      "seconds after that I started to feel sick to my stomach,\n",
      "ﬂeetingly thinking it was a really , really bad time to puke. I\n",
      "thought I opened my mouth to let them know I really\n",
      "wasn’t feeling all that well, but then suddenly everything\n",
      "went black. ICHAPTER TWENTY\n",
      "JACK\n",
      "t was one PM and still she hadn’t come out. I’d been in\n",
      "that waiting room for several hours already and still she\n",
      "wasn’t out. I felt like a caged animal, not only in that room,\n",
      "but in my own skin.\n",
      "I pace d every inch of the space, stopping next to the\n",
      "windows and staring out without seeing anything. I sat\n",
      "down on the green chairs  I now hated, closed my eyes, and\n",
      "leaned back…opened my eyes, rested my elbows on my\n",
      "legs, and put my head in my hands…yet still she wasn’t\n",
      "back.\n",
      "A family of three was waiting with me, a dad and two\n",
      "kids. One was a small girl who wouldn’t let go of her\n",
      "father’s hand, and the boy , maybe nine or ten, would pat his\n",
      "sister’s head every now and then and try to make  both the\n",
      "dad and the girl laugh. When they got the good news that\n",
      "their mom was out of surgery , I felt a surge of relief for\n",
      "them, but when no one came to tell me about Rose, I sank\n",
      "farther down in my seat.\n",
      "At one-ﬁfteen , my eyes on the door waiting for a nurse,\n",
      "to my surprise, Cynthia walked in.\n",
      "“What are you doing here?” I asked when she made it to\n",
      "my side.\n",
      "She sat down  in her own ugly green chair and settled in.\n",
      "“Wanted to check on you.” The bewilderment must have shown on my face because her expression softened and she\n",
      "patted my arm. “ Any news?”\n",
      "“No,” I grunted, resting my elbows on my parted legs\n",
      "again. “ Just waiting.”\n",
      "“That’s the hardest part.”\n",
      "My eyes on the door, I nodded. “Aren’t you supposed to\n",
      "be at work?”\n",
      "“My boss didn’t come in, so I’m taking a very long and\n",
      "late lunch break. Is there anything I can get you?”\n",
      "I shook my head.\n",
      "“She’ll be ﬁne, Jack. You’ll see. You just hold on so you\n",
      "can take care of her when she gets out.”\n",
      "I had no idea what she was talking about. I was ﬁne.\n",
      "We didn’t talk for at least thirty minutes. Finally , she\n",
      "sighed and got up. “I better get back. I’m trying to get all\n",
      "the urgent stuﬀ to the partners.”\n",
      "Clenching and unclenchin g my hands, I looked up at her\n",
      "from my seat, taking my eyes oﬀ the door. “Anyone making\n",
      "things hard for you?”\n",
      "She patted my cheek, and we were both surprised by the\n",
      "gesture. “You worry about yourself and Rose. I’ll handle the\n",
      "partners.”\n",
      "I jerked my head in a nod. “Thank you, Cynthia. I\n",
      "appreciate your help with everything these last few days. I\n",
      "know I dumped everything on you.”\n",
      "“She is changing you, you know .”\n",
      "My brows drew together . “What are you talking about\n",
      "now?” Distra ctedly , my gaze caught on the big clock on the\n",
      "wall right over the door: two PM.\n",
      "Starting to get angry , I got up and started pacing right\n",
      "next to the windows.\n",
      "“Nothing,” she murmured with a weird smile on her\n",
      "face.\n",
      "I only paused long enough to give her a quick look then\n",
      "continued with my pacing.\n",
      "“You’re gonna wear a hole in the ground.” Another look thrown her way , this time more menacing—\n",
      "at least I hoped it was. “Then I’ll wear a damn hole in the\n",
      "ground.”\n",
      "“Okay , I’m gonna leave you to your pacing now . Jack?”\n",
      "I stopped with a frustrated sigh and faced her . “What?”\n",
      "“Try not to lose her, okay? Don’t wait to tell her till it’s\n",
      "too late.”\n",
      "I ground my teeth together to keep my mouth shut. My\n",
      "gaze must have ﬁnally worked because she raised her\n",
      "hands in the air then started putting on her coat, gloves,\n",
      "scarf , and ﬁnally the bright red coat.\n",
      "When she shouldered her bag, she turned to me. “I’d\n",
      "appreciate it if you could let me know how the surgery\n",
      "went when she comes out.”\n",
      "To my own horror , I muttered, “If she comes out.”\n",
      "Luckily , Cynthia didn’t hear me and ﬁnally left.\n",
      "I spent  another hour in my own unwanted company , and\n",
      "more people trickled out of the room as they got their good\n",
      "news so they could be with their loved ones.\n",
      "Around three PM, Raymond walked in with balloons.\n",
      "Balloons. I didn’t know how I felt about that, but my body\n",
      "tightened to the point that I couldn’t have moved even if I’d\n",
      "wanted to. I knew she had a good relationship with him\n",
      "since he drove her almo st more than he drove me lately ,\n",
      "but I still didn’t know how I felt about him being there for\n",
      "her.\n",
      "With balloons .\n",
      "I hadn ’t brought anything, and I didn’t think I could\n",
      "manage to leave the hospital. The fact that she wanted to\n",
      "be with me and stop pretending cooled me enough that I\n",
      "didn’t demand he leave the second his eyes spotted me and\n",
      "he moved to my side with his ridiculous balloons.\n",
      "He left an empty seat between us and sat down.\n",
      "I couldn’t keep my mouth shut. “Balloons, Raymond?” I\n",
      "asked, the words coming out as a low growl,\n",
      "unintentionally…or maybe not. He cleared his throat. “Not from me.”\n",
      "I linked my hands together , glancing at him and then the\n",
      "balloons. There was a big blue one that said Get Well Soon\n",
      "and a few more colorful ones around it.\n",
      "“I came from Around the Corner .” He thrust a brown\n",
      "paper bag at me with Rose’s shop’s little logo on the side.\n",
      "Curious, I took it and looked inside: one cup of what\n",
      "smelled like coﬀee, one sandwich, and a muﬀin. I put it\n",
      "down on the ﬂoor. Rose made the sandwiches herself every\n",
      "morning. She used a spread she’d come up with on her\n",
      "own, as she’d  told me countless times. Knowing she hadn’t\n",
      "made these, even though I hadn’t had anything since our\n",
      "dinner the night before, I couldn’t even stomach eating\n",
      "them. I picked up the coﬀee since I could’ve used a little\n",
      "more energy for more pacing.\n",
      "Raymond continued, “I thought I could drop by and see\n",
      "if they needed any help with anything, and the girl—Sally , I\n",
      "think—she handed me the balloons when she heard I was\n",
      "coming here next.”\n",
      "I grunted unintelligibly . That was better .\n",
      "“How is it? Are they busy?” I asked a moment later .\n",
      "“Yes. There was a line at the register . She is doing  great.\n",
      "Oh, they also said they’d be here as soon as they closed\n",
      "down, to check on her .”\n",
      "I nodded; I had expected as much. Since she wanted to\n",
      "be with me, I didn’t have to worry about the other one who\n",
      "worked with her early in the mornings anymore, whatever\n",
      "his name was.\n",
      "We fell silent.\n",
      "“Any news?” he asked after a few moments.\n",
      "I ran my hand over my face. “Not a goddamn thing.”\n",
      "“When did they take her in?”\n",
      "“Eight. I don’t know when they started, though. She\n",
      "must’ve waited for a while.”\n",
      "“How long is this surgery supposed to last?” That was what was scaring the hell out of me. When\n",
      "we’d spoken to the doctor and I’d asked him how long\n",
      "these surgeries usually lasted, he hadn’t given me a\n",
      "straight answer , which was expected, but he’d said other\n",
      "times it had lasted anywhere from forty-ﬁve minutes to\n",
      "three hours. We had passed the three-hour mark a while\n",
      "ago, so I knew something must have gone wrong.\n",
      "I rubb ed a hand over my heart when I felt it tighten\n",
      "painfully . “She should’ve been out by now .”\n",
      "Raymond took a look at me and didn’t say anything else.\n",
      "All I could do was play with her ring, which was a dead\n",
      "weight in my pocket, and hope she was doing ﬁne and\n",
      "holding on. We sat like that for another two hours until\n",
      "ﬁnally  a damn nurse made her way toward us instead of\n",
      "going to someone else.\n",
      "I sprun g up from my seat, my limbs prickling from all\n",
      "the hours I had sat on that uncomfortable chair .\n",
      "“She is out of surgery now and in the recovery room.”\n",
      "She smiled at us, as if everything was perfectly ﬁne. She\n",
      "should’ve come down there hours ago .\n",
      "“When can I see her?” I growled.\n",
      "“We’ll go up to her room now , and you can wait there.”\n",
      "“I think I’ve waited enough,” I snapped. “Take me to see\n",
      "her.”\n",
      "The nurse lost her smile  and scowled back at me. That\n",
      "was ﬁne.\n",
      "“She’s been in surgery for quite some time now , so we’re\n",
      "just anxious to see her,” Raymond spoke up. “Waiting for\n",
      "her in the room would be great, thank you.”\n",
      "The woman, probably somewhere in her ﬁfties based on\n",
      "her black and white natural hair, lost some of her stern\n",
      "look, which I didn’t care for , and then she sighed.\n",
      "“They’ll bring  her up to the room as soon as she is ready .\n",
      "They need to keep an eye on her until she starts coming\n",
      "around from the anesthesia.” “Is she okay?” I rushed  the words out, taking a step\n",
      "forward. “Did something go wrong?”\n",
      "“I’m sure she is ﬁne. The doctor will come to her room\n",
      "to check on things later and he’ll be able to give you more\n",
      "information. Now follow me, please.”\n",
      "Up in her room, nothing changed. I barely took in the\n",
      "surroundings as we walked into the private room I’d paid\n",
      "for. There was a big TV mounted on the wall right across\n",
      "from the hospital bed, a leather couch right under the big\n",
      "window where the whole  city was laid out in front of you,\n",
      "and then two comfortable  enough chairs on the left side of\n",
      "the bed. There was also a door to what looked like a private\n",
      "bathroom on the left side as soon as you walked into the\n",
      "room. Raymond stood closer to the door with his ridiculous\n",
      "and cheerful  balloons and wisely stayed out of my way as I\n",
      "started my pacing again.\n",
      "“Tie those stupid things to a chair or something. You\n",
      "look ridiculo us, for God’s sake,” I growled when he just\n",
      "stood there. I ignored the twitch of R aymond’s lips.\n",
      "An hour—it took them another fucking hour to bring her\n",
      "up. As soon as they rolled  her in, I rushed to her side. I was\n",
      "having trouble keeping my distance as they transferred her\n",
      "onto the bed.\n",
      "Her eyes were barely open, she had a white tampon-\n",
      "looking thing  in her nose, and she had slight bruisi ng under\n",
      "her right eye. I moved my gaze over every inch of her face\n",
      "and her body, but other than that, I couldn’t see anything\n",
      "wrong with her. She looked tired and worn out, but she\n",
      "seemed to be okay .\n",
      "“How are you feeling?” I asked as soon as the guys who\n",
      "had brought her in left the room.\n",
      "She reached for my hand, and my goddamn heart\n",
      "skipped a fucking beat. I grabbed it with both hands and\n",
      "held on tight.\n",
      "Her eyes were suspicious ly wet. “I feel really tired. My\n",
      "head hurts and my stomach is stinging, but I think I’m ﬁne. How did it go? What time is it?” she croaked, her voice\n",
      "barely audible.\n",
      "I brushed her messy bangs out of her face and leaned\n",
      "down to press a lingering kiss on her forehead.\n",
      "“You took ten years oﬀ of my life, Rose,” I whispered\n",
      "right next to her ear, resting my temple against  hers. “I\n",
      "don’t know how you’re going to pay me back for this, but\n",
      "you better think of something.”\n",
      "She tried to frown, but even that she couldn’t manage\n",
      "fully. “What? What are you talking about?”\n",
      "“You’ve been in surgery for seven, almost eight hours.”\n",
      "“Oh. It’s been that long? I didn’t realize.”\n",
      "She slowly lifted her hand , which still had a little needle\n",
      "taped to it, and gingerly touched the side of her nose.\n",
      "“There is a tampon in there, I think,” I comm ented\n",
      "unnecessarily .\n",
      "Her eyes darted around the room and spotted Raymond\n",
      "a moment later. “Oh, Ray. Hi.” She paused as if waiting for\n",
      "the right words to come to her . “I’m sorry . I didn’t see you.”\n",
      "Ray.\n",
      "I gripped the bedrail, wondering what the hell was\n",
      "wrong with me that all of a sudden I was acting very\n",
      "unreasonable, especially since it wasn’t the ﬁrst time she\n",
      "had called him R ay.\n",
      "He stepped forward with the damn balloons, and Rose’s\n",
      "smile got wider .\n",
      "“You brought me balloons? Thank you so much.” She\n",
      "looked up at me. “ Jack, he brought me balloons.”\n",
      "I hadn’t brought her shit. I gave Raymond another\n",
      "murderous look.\n",
      "“They’re not from me, I’m afraid,” Raymond started. “I\n",
      "dropped by your shop before I came here, and Sally wanted\n",
      "me to get them to you so you could see them when you\n",
      "woke up. How are you doing, kiddo?”\n",
      "I relaxed further at Raymond’s nickname for Rose and\n",
      "watched as her smile got all wobbly . “I’m okay, I think…a little dizzy, and I feel a little oﬀ. My head hurts… did I say\n",
      "that? Still better than what I expected. I must look like\n",
      "hell,” she mumbled and tried to chuckle, the sound nothing\n",
      "like her warm laughter .\n",
      "I squeezed her hand, and her eyes came to me as I softly\n",
      "said, “ You look beautiful.”\n",
      "She groaned, trying to sit up a little straighter . “Uh oh, I\n",
      "really must look like hell.” She looked back at Raymond.\n",
      "“Jack’s usua l complimen ts are more like You look awful ,\n",
      "You look tired , You look like hell, or You look like a mess. ” I\n",
      "scowled at her and she ﬂashed me a small and tired smile.\n",
      "“Did I miss any?”\n",
      "“I’ll give you new compliments you can add to your list\n",
      "as soon as you’re out of here. Don’t worry .”\n",
      "“Thank you for trying to make me feel better .”\n",
      "Raymond’s suppressed laughter got my attention,  and I\n",
      "looked up from Rose.\n",
      "He patted her leg, two gentle thumps. “He isn’t lying.\n",
      "For someone who just came out of a seven-hour surgery ,\n",
      "you look great. I’m going to leave you two alone. I just\n",
      "wanted to say hi and see how you’re doing.” His eyes met\n",
      "mine. “If you need anything, I’ll be waiting close by .”\n",
      "I nodded and, after another look at Rose, he left.\n",
      "Her eyes were starting to close on their own, but when I\n",
      "gave her hand a gentle  squeeze, she turned her head\n",
      "toward me.\n",
      "“Jack—”\n",
      "“How are we doing?” An older red-haired nurse named\n",
      "Kelly walked in, and she started checking Rose’s blood\n",
      "pressure. “Everything okay?” she asked with a generous\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "“I think so,” Rose replied.\n",
      "“Your blood pressure looks good. Let’s see if you have\n",
      "any fever .”\n",
      "“Is the doctor coming?” I asked, and she turned her\n",
      "smile toward me. “He’ll be here soon enoug h. We need to start another IV\n",
      "on you, so you can just sit back and relax now. If you have\n",
      "pain, I’ll get you a paink iller after you have your dinner .\n",
      "Sound good?”\n",
      "“Okay .”\n",
      "“You don’t have a fever , so that’s great. I’ll come back\n",
      "and check everything every hour . Okay?”\n",
      "The nurse walked out, and Rose’s head rolled toward me\n",
      "on the pillow . “Hi, Jack.”\n",
      "Looking into her eyes, I reached out with my right hand\n",
      "and ran the backs of my ﬁngers across her cheek. “Hey .”\n",
      "“How bad does it look? You don’t have to lie.” Her voice\n",
      "was still cracked and hoarse.\n",
      "“Bad enough.”\n",
      "Her lips moved up an inch or so, her eyes closing.\n",
      "“That’s more like you.”\n",
      "The nurse walked in with the IV bag, so I had to pull my\n",
      "hand back from her face.\n",
      "The doctor came in two hours later when Rose had had\n",
      "small naps with her mouth open in between the blood\n",
      "pressure and fever checks. Every time she woke up, she’d\n",
      "look around the room and say my name when her eyes\n",
      "found mine. Every one of those times I got up and went to\n",
      "her side to assure her I hadn’t left.\n",
      "I looked like hell. Even more than that, I felt like I was\n",
      "living in hell. I wasn’t cut out for stuﬀ like this. I didn’t\n",
      "know the right words to say. I was more likely to mess\n",
      "things up.\n",
      "“How are we doing?” Dr . Martin asked.\n",
      "Rose had just woken up so she pushed herself up in the\n",
      "bed.\n",
      "“Not too bad,” she said. “My stomach hurts a little.”\n",
      "“Yes. You remember what we talked about before, right?\n",
      "To patch the leak, we needed cartilage and other tissues\n",
      "from either your nose, your stomach, or the back of your\n",
      "ear, and—” “I thought you said it was going to be from the nose,” I\n",
      "cut in.\n",
      "“Yes, that was the initial  plan, but the tear was bigger\n",
      "than what we’d hoped for .”\n",
      "“Is that why it lasted over seven hours?”\n",
      "“Again, yes. The tear was bigger and farther back than\n",
      "we expected , so it took a while to patch it, and if we had\n",
      "taken the tissue from the nose, it wouldn’t have been\n",
      "enough. I didn’t expect the operation to take that long\n",
      "either . Like we discussed before, it’s usually a few hours at\n",
      "most, but it was successful, and that’s what’s important.”\n",
      "“I can’t really breathe through my nose,” Rose said,\n",
      "getting the doctor’s attention.\n",
      "“That’s norm al. You have packing in it right now and it’ll\n",
      "have to stay in at least two, maybe three more days.”\n",
      "“When can I get out?”\n",
      "He ﬂashed Rose a smile. “Trying to get away from  us so\n",
      "quickly?”\n",
      "“No, I just—”\n",
      "He patted Rose’s arm. “That’s ﬁne. You’ll be our guest\n",
      "for a few more days, maybe a week. We need to keep an\n",
      "eye on you for a while and see how things are going.”\n",
      "They had operated so close to her brain and because of\n",
      "the tear in the membrane, there was no protection. “Is\n",
      "infection a concern?” I asked.\n",
      "“Infection is always a concern with any operation.\n",
      "Because we were so close to her brain, we just need to\n",
      "keep a close eye on her to make sure everything is healing\n",
      "smoothly .”\n",
      "“When will we know if it’s still leaking?” Rose asked.\n",
      "“I’ll order another CT scan in a few days after we take\n",
      "the packing out and see how things are looking. After you\n",
      "get out of here, I’ll need you to do another MRI scan in a\n",
      "few weeks.” Rose stiﬀened in bed. “I know you have trouble\n",
      "with that, but we need to see if everything is okay .” She nodded  and I took her hand. It seemed like I\n",
      "couldn’t control myself anymore.\n",
      "“Okay . I’ll be checking on you every day , but a few things\n",
      "you need to know before I go: I need you to take a few pills\n",
      "morning and night. The nurse will get them to you before\n",
      "you take your meals. Also, there will be a syrup for\n",
      "constipation that you need to have two times a day .”\n",
      "Rose groaned and I tightened my grip around our linked\n",
      "ﬁngers.\n",
      "“We can’t have you straining in any way. You need to\n",
      "keep taking the syrup even after you leave us, probably for\n",
      "about a month. Do not bend forward because we don’t want\n",
      "any pressure in your skull. After you get out of the hospital,\n",
      "you need to stay in bed for at least another two weeks and\n",
      "keep your head high with two or more pillows. You’ll visit\n",
      "us for check -ups in the meantime, and we’ll talk about\n",
      "these things in more depth when you’re ready to leave. For\n",
      "now, no tilting your head down, no sneezing.”\n",
      "“I’m guessing I’m not allowed to sleep on my face then?”\n",
      "“No. I’m afraid that’s not gonna be possible for quite a\n",
      "while. A few months. If you don’t have any other questions,\n",
      "I’ll see you tomorrow .”\n",
      "Another round of blood pressure and fever checks\n",
      "happened right before her employees and now friends\n",
      "showed up with cinna mon rolls, brownies, and two\n",
      "sandwiches.\n",
      "As Sally approached, Owen stayed back, at the foot of\n",
      "the bed. I was standing on her left side.\n",
      "“Hi,” Rose whispered to Sally’s smiling face.\n",
      "“Hey ,” she said back. “Sorry we couldn’t come before.\n",
      "We got all the good news  from Raymond though. How are\n",
      "you doing?”\n",
      "She rocked her hand in a so-so gesture. “How did it go\n",
      "at the coﬀee shop?”\n",
      "“Everything went well. Don’t even worry about a thing\n",
      "on that front.” Her eyes went to Owen. “Thank you for saying yes to\n",
      "working full-time, Owen. I don’t know what I would’ve done\n",
      "if you hadn’t accepted.”\n",
      "“We would’ve found you someone else,” I interrupted,\n",
      "but she seemed to ignore me.\n",
      "They stayed for another ten minutes and then left after\n",
      "promising to call her a few times the next day with updates\n",
      "on how things were going. Her dinner arrive d a few\n",
      "minutes later .\n",
      "“I don’t want anything,” Rose protested.\n",
      "“You’ll eat so you can have your pills. You heard the\n",
      "doctor .”\n",
      "“Just a little then.”\n",
      "“Yes, just a little.” I moved the rails down and sat on the\n",
      "edge of the bed after we adjusted it so she could sit upright\n",
      "enough to have a few bites of the beef stew and rice. She\n",
      "could barely lift her arms, let alone feed herself . “How do\n",
      "you feel?”\n",
      "“Still a little loopy , I think, and very , very tired.”\n",
      "“Do you want to have some of the sandwich Sally\n",
      "brought in or this?”\n",
      "She scrunch ed up her nose. “I don’t think I can handle\n",
      "the sandwich right now . Soft is better .”\n",
      "I cut a small bite oﬀ of a potato and gently placed it in\n",
      "her open mouth. She chewed it very slowly .\n",
      "“I can’t breathe through my nose, Jack.”\n",
      "“Dr. Martin said that was normal.”\n",
      "Next, I gave her a piece of beef, following it with some\n",
      "rice.\n",
      "I felt like a true bastard,  because there was something\n",
      "about feeding her that was getting to me. It was an\n",
      "intimacy we hadn’t shared before.\n",
      "“Would you like some water?”\n",
      "“I’m sorry ,” she said, still chewing as she looked away\n",
      "from me for the ﬁrst time.\n",
      "“Sorry for what?” “You’re doing a lot more than what we agreed to .”\n",
      "I tried not to stiﬀen and just kept feeding her small\n",
      "bites. “I thought we were done pretending—or did you\n",
      "forget what you said before surgery?”\n",
      "“I—” I force d another forkful of rice and potatoes into\n",
      "her mouth before she could respond. “Of course I\n",

      "“If you remember then stop saying stupid things and\n",
      "keep eating.”\n",
      "A smile tugged at her lips. “Okay .”\n",
      "Eventually , the nurses changed shift, and after the last\n",
      "check, I turned the lights oﬀ .\n",
      "Rose’s eyes followed me as I made my way back to her\n",
      "side, her body slightly turned to the right, her head facing\n",
      "up.\n",
      "“What’s wrong?” I asked, pulling the covers higher so\n",
      "her shoulders were covered.\n",
      "“My nose is a little tender . It hurts when I touch it.”\n",
      "“Stop touching it then. Do you want water?”\n",
      "“A little.”\n",
      "I helped her up and she sipped from a straw , only a few\n",
      "pulls.\n",
      "“Enough?”\n",
      "She nodded and settled down.\n",
      "I turne d away to put the water bottle on the bedside\n",

      "“What?”\n",
      "“Are you staying tonight?” It wasn’t completely dark in the room, but it was still\n",
      "hard for me to see her eyes and try to understand what was\n",
      "going on in her mind. Her eyes always gave her emotions\n",
      "away .\n",
      "“You didn’t bring anything with you—no clothes, no bag\n",
      "—so I wasn’t sure if you’d stay tonight. You have work\n",
      "tomorrow so if you can’t…that’s okay .”\n",
      "All I could hear from her tone of voice was that she\n",

      "out even if they’d tried to anyway .\n",
      "“I forgot to bring a bag. I wasn’t thinking about that,” I\n",
      "muttered.\n",

      "“So then you are staying?”\n",
      "I leaned down, pressing a gentle kiss on the edge of her\n",
      "lips as she closed her eyes. “Always,” I said, my voice raw.\n",
      "“Even when the time comes that you don’t want me\n",
      "anywhere near you.”\n",
      "She smiled a little. “I like having you around, so I doubt\n",
      "that will happen.”\n",

      "ROSE\n",
      "he next few days I spen t at the hospital were hard.\n",
      "More tests and doctor visits resumed, and I felt like I\n",
      "was about to lose my mind. I’d never appreciated the\n",
      "outdoors as much as I did in that hospital room.\n",
      "The only good moments came at night, with Jack.\n",
      "I wasn’t sure if I was feeling extra vulnerable beca use of\n",
      "the surgery and my sickn ess, but what I was starting to feel\n",
      "for him seemed like it was tripling every night we spent\n",
      "together in that spacious hospital room I couldn’t possibly\n",
      "have aﬀorded on my own.\n",
      "It was the second or third night, I was having trouble\n",
      "sleeping because of all the mouth breathing I had to do,\n",
      "and I just couldn’t get comfortable with the fact that I\n",
      "couldn’t breathe through my nose.\n",
      "The room was dark when he spoke, and the world\n",
      "outside my room was quiet other than the footsteps of the\n",
      "nurses walking by to check on patients every now and then.\n",
      "“You’re not sleeping,” Jack said quietly . It wasn’t a\n",
      "question.\n",
      "I had my back to him because I wanted him to get some\n",
      "sleep and not have to worry about me. He worried about\n",
      "me quite a lot, and just realizing that fact had made me so\n",
      "extremely happy . I rolled  over slowly , making sure I wasn’t lying completely on my side and my head was tilted toward\n",
      "the ceiling.\n",
      "It wasn’t completely dark in the room, not with all the\n",
      "city lights and the light slipping in underneath the door\n",
      "from the hallway , but it wasn’t as clear as day either . He\n",
      "was lying on the couch, his legs crossed at the ankles. He\n",
      "was wearing  pants and a thin, navy blue sweater , which\n",
      "were his casual clothes. I didn’t know why he didn’t wear\n",
      "something more comfortable.\n",
      "“No,” I replied. “But I’m trying.”\n",
      "“Do you need anything?”\n",
      "“No. Thank you. Are you okay there?”\n",
      "“I’m ﬁne. Try to go to sleep.”\n",
      "We were silent for a long time. I was staring up at the\n",
      "ceiling when he spoke again.\n",
      "“It started snowing.”\n",
      "I rolled my head and looked out the window . Sure\n",
      "enough, you could make out the white ﬂurries ﬂying\n",
      "around. It looked beautiful, and if it held, the city would be\n",
      "covered in white. Winter  in NYC was my favorite time of\n",
      "the year, and Christmas would arrive soon—not that I’d be\n",
      "up and running then, but still…Christmas was coming.\n",
      "“First snow…it’s beautiful. I wish we could go outside\n",
      "and actually feel it. I love snow .”\n",
      "“There will be more.”\n",
      "“Jack? Can I ask for something?”\n",
      "“Of course.”\n",
      "Before I could even say what I wanted, he was up and by\n",
      "my side. I looked up at him in the dark. I couldn’t make out\n",
      "his features clearly , but I was sure he looked amazing. He\n",
      "always did. He was always so put together , and more than\n",
      "that, there was something about the way he carried\n",
      "himself , so conﬁdent and aloof . It pulled you in and kept\n",
      "hold of you. The fact that he looked like a movie star—a\n",
      "really grumpy one—was just an added bonus.\n",
      "“Do you need water?” He ran his ﬁngers through my hair and waited for me to\n",
      "answer . He’d been doing that a lot the last few days, which\n",
      "was why I didn’t think he’d turn me down when I made my\n",
      "next request.\n",
      "“Could you lie with me?” His ﬁngers stilled in my hair. “I\n",
      "know it wouldn’t be comfortable, but just for a little while.”\n",
      "“Are you cold?”\n",
      "“Nope.”\n",
      "Before he could say no, I scooted back to give him a\n",
      "little space. Thanks to the private room, the bed wasn’t as\n",
      "small as the usual hospital beds. Without another word, he\n",
      "lay down next to me.\n",
      "I turned to my side.\n",
      "“You’re supposed to lie on your back, not on your side.”\n",
      "“Thank you for reminding  me, doctor , but the back of my\n",
      "head is tingli ng, and I can barely feel my head. I’ll just stay\n",
      "like this for a few minutes, that’s all.”\n",
      "He ﬁnally turned his head to look at me. “How are you\n",
      "feeling?”\n",
      "“Better . I don’t have much pain, which is surprising. The\n",
      "headaches aren’t so bad either . I think I could go home.”\n",
      "I notic ed his lips moving up an inch. “Not so fast. We’re\n",
      "here for a few more days.”\n",
      "So that didn’t work.\n",
      "“You haven’t been going to work.”\n",
      "“And?”\n",
      "“Can you take so many days oﬀ like this?”\n",
      "“I can do whatever I want.”\n",
      "“But don’t you have clients and whatever stuﬀ that you\n",
      "need to get back to?\n",
      "“Are you trying to get rid of me, Rose?”\n",
      "I scooted closer to him and pushed my hand under my\n",
      "cheek. “Nope .” I didn’t want to get rid of him at all. I pulled\n",
      "on the cover he was lying on top of, and as soon as he\n",
      "moved to the side and it was clear , I threw it over him,\n",
      "leaning over and making sure he was covered. “What’s going on here?”\n",
      "“Just so you won’t be cold,” I muttered, securing him to\n",
      "my side. It was more like Just so you can’t leave.\n",
      "He turned to his side as well, staring straight into my\n",
      "soul.\n",
      "“What’s going on?” he repeated, softer .\n",
      "“Please tell me this is real,” I whispered. “What I’m\n",
      "starting to feel for you…what I think we have. Please tell\n",
      "me it’s real and I’m not just imagining it.”\n",
      "My right hand was resting on my hip then a second later\n",
      "it was resting on his broad chest, our ﬁngers linked\n",
      "together . “You’re not imagining it.”\n",
      "“Do you think it’s smart?”\n",
      "“You and I?”\n",
      "I nodded.\n",
      "“Who cares about being smart. We’re already married\n",
      "so…there is no reason why we shouldn’t go there.”\n",
      "“Right?” I agreed, perkin g up. “I was thinking the same\n",
      "thing. It’d be a waste of a marriage.”\n",
      "“And if you don’t think it’s working or you don’t think\n",
      "I’m what you want, it’ll go back to what it was.”\n",
      "“Same goes for you, of course. Sometimes I can be an\n",
      "acquired taste. I know that.”\n",
      "He chuckled,  and it warmed something inside me. He let\n",
      "go of my hand and cupped my cheek. The hairs on my arms\n",
      "stood up, and I could do nothing but close the distance\n",
      "between us, needing to get closer to him. Only a few inches\n",
      "were left between us.\n",
      "“I’m the one who is an acquired taste in this\n",
      "relationship, and we both know that,” he said.\n",
      "Gently , I laid my head on his shoulder , but then he lifted\n",
      "his arm so I could lie on his chest. We settled in better after\n",
      "that.\n",
      "He moved his hand under the covers and came out with\n",
      "something between his ﬁngers. My heart jumped in my chest when I saw what he had\n",
      "for me. “My ring!”\n",
      "“I thought I should hold on to it until you were feeling\n",
      "better ,” he explained.\n",
      "“I’m good. I’m okay.” I held up my hand between us,\n",
      "impatient for him to put it back on. His ﬁngertips slid along\n",
      "my ring ﬁnger and he pushed it back until it was securely\n",
      "in place. I stared at it for a little while in the dark.\n",
      "I close d my eyes and let out a deep breath from my\n",
      "mouth. “How do you feel about Thursdays?”\n",
      "“How should I feel about them?”\n",
      "“Like pizza, maybe? We can do pasta on Mondays and\n",
      "pizza on Thursdays.”\n",
      "“We can argue about the toppings.”\n",
      "“Sounds fun to me.”\n",
      "“Good. Now go to sleep.”\n",
      "With a smile  on my face,  I snuggled in closer . “I have a\n",
      "good feeling about this, Jack Hawthorne. I have  a really\n",
      "good feeling about this.”\n",
      "I smile d even bigger when he whispered, “It’ll work. I\n",
      "promise you, Rose.”\n",
      "Jack and I, we were made in a crappy hospital bed,\n",
      "whispering our secrets, dreams and promises to each other .\n",
      "We were holding each other close as if what we had, what\n",
      "we were forming and building would be taken away from us\n",
      "with the sunlight.\n",
      "FOUR  DAYS  AFTER  THE  SURGERY , they ﬁnally took out the\n",
      "packing in my nose, and to say it was an experience would\n",
      "be an understatement. I’m not ashamed to admit that I\n",
      "cried for a solid ten minutes after it was done as Jack let\n",
      "me hold on to him tightly in our room and told me to stop\n",
      "crying. Every thing seemed to be catching up with me, and then when they took out the damn thing—which I’d thought\n",
      "was only a few inches in but actually reached all the way up\n",
      "to my forehead, if not higher—I couldn’t keep it together\n",
      "any longer . I hadn’t cried  since the surgery , so I supposed I\n",
      "was due.\n",
      "The nights with Jack continued to be the only highlights\n",
      "of my day. I was secretly hoping we’d get to sleep in the\n",
      "same bed when we went back to his apartment, because I\n",
      "was already getting used to feeling his body and touch\n",
      "right next to mine.\n",
      "When I had ﬁrst met and married this man, I hadn’t\n",
      "understood him, but he had surprised me at every turn\n",
      "from day one. I couldn’t believe I’d thought the man lying\n",
      "next to me was cold and detached. He had proven\n",
      "otherwise with his actions countless times.\n",
      "With all of that in my mind, I was feeling surpr isingly\n",
      "torn about leaving the hospital, feeling afraid things would\n",
      "change once we got back to the real world as Dr. Martin\n",
      "gave me his last warnin gs on the day I was set to be\n",
      "discharged.\n",
      "“You’re on bed rest for two weeks, Rose.”\n",
      "“Can I get back to work after that?”\n",
      "“You have a cafe, right?” he asked.\n",
      "“Yes. I won’t work too much, but I’d like to get back out\n",
      "there as quickly as I can.”\n",
      "“Fine. You can go back to work, but you can’t work like\n",
      "you used to. Don’t overdo  it. Sit down and look over things,\n",
      "and only a few hours at ﬁrst. Listen to your body—if it tells\n",
      "you it’s tired, you stop doing whatever you’re doing. No\n",

      "with the good doctor .\n",
      "“Yes, no sex for quite a while.” “What’s quite a while exactly?” I pushed, probably\n",
      "surprising everyone in the room.\n",
      "“At least three months. No alcohol for at least three\n",

      "The ﬁrst few days we were back from the hospital, she\n",

      "me at the same time. Stopping that nonsense, I pulled her\n",
      "back against  me and met her waiting lips with a better and\n",
      "longer kiss than she’d given me. We were both out of\n",
      "breath, and my cock had very diﬀerent ideas about how we\n",

      "During lunch  time, I found myself on her doorstep with\n",

      "full of people , both at the tables and at the bar. She came\n",
      "alive in this place, looked perfect with a smile on her face,\n",

      "A few people who were occupying the table in front of\n",

      "slightly , and her eyes came to me. I smiled at her, and her\n",
      "smile turned into a big grin. Then she noticed the ﬂowers in\n",
      "my arms. Gently , she slid down the stool and came around the counter , meeting me halfway . Even though I’d dropped\n",
      "her oﬀ just a few hours earlier , I could hardly take my eyes\n",
      "oﬀ of her. I didn’t think I was ever gonna get enough of that\n",
      "smile.\n",
      "We were only inches apart when she stopped and\n",
      "whispered uncertainly . “Is it okay to kiss you?”\n",
      "I lost my smile and frowned down at her. “What kind of\n",

      "“We haven’t kissed in public since we decided to be…”\n",
      "She moved her hands back and forth between us. “This.”\n",

      "into her ear. “How about  we try it and see what happens.”\n",
      "When our eyes met, hers were smiling at me. Finally , she\n",
      "tipped her head back, her lips met mine, and she opened\n",
      "her mouth to me. A few seconds into the kiss, right when it\n",
      "was getting better , we had to stop when a new group of\n",
      "customers walked in.\n",
      "“There,” I said, my voice hoarse.\n",
      "“There,” she echoed, her own voice husky . She grinned\n",
      "up at me and pulled me to the side as Sally took care of the\n",
      "newcomers. “The roses are for me, I assume?” she asked,\n",
      "bouncing on her feet a little.\n",
      "Finally I remembered the damn things and handed them\n",
      "to her. She took them from me with a gentleness that broke\n",
      "my heart. The ﬁrst time I’d brought her ﬂowers on the\n",
      "opening day, she had done the same thing with an\n",
      "expression that read like she couldn’t believe all of them\n",
      "were hers. It both pissed  me oﬀ and broke my heart. I’d\n",
      "buy her ﬂowers every day if it meant that look would\n",

      "Closing her eyes, she smelled a white rose. “Can this be\n",
      "your Monday thing? If you’re gonna buy them every\n",
      "Monday , that is. I mean, if you do, can you be the one who\n",
      "brings them over? Instead of the ﬂorist?”\n",
      "“If that’s what you want, I can do that, Rose,” I said\n",
      "softly . She nodded slowly; I knew she didn’t like to jostle her\n",
      "head too much.\n",
      "“Can you wait for a second? I’ll leave these in the\n",
      "kitchen and come right back. W ait, all right?”\n",
      "“I’m not going anywhere.”\n",
      "She rushed away at a slower pace than her usual and\n",
      "came back out a moment later .\n",
      "“Just put them in some water . Also, they delivered the\n",
      "wreaths this morning. Garlands and other stuﬀ for the front\n",

      "She laughed . “No, I won’t. I know . I meant I didn’t let\n",
      "Owen put them up. I thought maybe you and I could…”\n",
      "I could n’t help it—I leaned down and kissed her again.\n",
      "“Yes. You and I. It’s always you and I from now on.”\n",
      "To my surpri se, she rose up on her toes and hugged me.\n",
      "Carefully , I wrapped my hands around her waist and\n",
      "plastered her to my body, holding tight. Her hair smelled of\n",
      "pears, it was her new shampoo, and I found myself closing\n",
      "my eyes and breathing in her scent. Too soon, she let go\n",
      "and dropped back down to her heels.\n",
      "“What was that for?”\n",
      "She ran her hands down my chest, adjusting my tie as\n",
      "she shrugged . “Just because. And I feel ﬁne. You don’t have\n",
      "to take me back to the apartment just yet. Sally and Owen\n",
      "are doing all the real work.”\n",
      "“That’s not why I came,” I lied. I had come to check up\n",
      "on her and see if she wanted to go back home. Just in case\n",
      "she wanted to leave or wasn’t feeling okay, I wanted to be\n",
      "the one who took care of her , not R aymond.\n",
      "“Oh?”\n",
      "“I wanted to have lunch with you, but if you’re busy—”\n",
      "Her eyebrows rose and her smile widened. “No, not busy\n",

      "about that.\n",
      "The bell over the door chimed and her smiling eyes\n",
      "shifted in that direction. In just a second, right in front of\n",
      "me, all the color in her face drained and her expression\n",
      "went blank until she looked nothing like my Rose. I looked\n",
      "over my shoulder .\n",
      "Joshua Landon.\n",
      "He was staring at Rose, and she was staring right back.\n",
      "I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Rage like I’d never\n",

      "pummel him where he was standing.\n",
      "When Rose moved, my hand shot out and I caught her\n",

      "Jack.”\n",
      "No. No, it wasn’t okay .\n",
      "Joshua made it to our side.\n",
      "“Hawthorne.” He inclined his head to me then turned\n",
      "his entire focus on Rose. When my ﬁngers were starting to\n",
      "curl, forming ﬁsts, I had to let go of Rose’s arm before my\n",
      "grip could hurt her. Instead, I linked our ﬁngers together\n",
      "and faced Joshua like that. He noticed it, as I wanted him\n",
      "to, but his only reaction was a ﬂeeting grin I was just\n",
      "itching to wipe oﬀ of his smug face.\n",
      "“Rose.”\n",
      "“What are you doing here, Joshua?” she asked, her grip\n",
      "around my ﬁngers just as tight as mine around hers.\n",
      "“I heard you had a little health problem. I wanted to see\n",
      "how you were doing, and, well…” His hands in his pockets,\n",
      "he looked around the coﬀee shop with an appreciative\n",
      "smile and shrugged. “I also wanted to see your place. You\n",
      "wanted this for such a long time, and I’m glad you ﬁnally\n",
      "made it happen, honey .”\n",
      "I started to draw in slow and steady breaths. The\n",
      "endearment coming from his lips kept echoing in my brain. He was goad ing me. It was only by sheer luck that I was\n",
      "holding myself together when I wanted to kill him.\n",
      "“I had surgery , and I’m ﬁne. Where did you hear about\n",
      "it?”\n",
      "“Here and there.”\n",
      "Roses’s ﬁngers tightened around mine.\n",
      "“If I had known before, I would have visited you at the\n",
      "hospital. I hate to think you were going through that alone.\n",
      "But then again, you like to be alone, don’t you.”\n",
      "Rose took a side step and rested her shoulder against\n",
      "my arm. We looked like an unbreakable unit in front of him,\n",
      "and I liked that. “Thank you for your concern, but I wasn’t\n",
      "alone. My husband was with me.”\n",
      "The son of a bitch tilted his head and fully took me in.\n",
      "When the smug bastard smiled, my jaw clenched, and\n",
      "without even realizing what I was doing, I took a step\n",
      "forward, only to feel Rose’s arm wrap around mine to keep\n",
      "me in place.\n",
      "“Your husband. Right. I can see that,” he murmured with\n",
      "amusement.\n",

      "me and Joshua, it seemed.\n",
      "“She…” He faltered, eyes ﬂitting my way. “She’s good.\n",
      "Rose, I want you to know it wasn’t anything  we had\n",
      "planned, and it had nothing to do with—”\n",
      "“I don’t need or want your explanation. It’s not my\n",
      "business what either one of you does.”\n",
      "More customers trickled in, and Sally called out to Rose.\n",
      "After a quick  look shot my way, she went to see what Sally\n",
      "wanted. Leaving me with Joshua.\n",
      "I ﬁsted my hand, my eyes ﬁxed on him.\n",

      "up you might not be here and who knows what will come\n",
      "up. So if I were you, I’d answer my calls.” Before I could slip in a word, Rose came back to my\n",
      "side.\n",
      "Joshua turned his attentio n to her. “You seem to be busy\n",
      "so I won’t keep you any longer . I just wanted to see that\n",

      "in the end Rose, but you can’t even imagine how hard it\n",
      "was for me.”\n",
      "He leaned forward, and every muscle in my body tensed.\n",
      "Rose leaned back before he could get to her, and Joshua\n",
      "somehow feigned a very believable hurt expression as he\n",

      "“I deserved that too,” Joshua murmured, but there was a\n",
      "hardness in his eyes. He didn’t like what he heard at all.\n",
      "He nodded to her once and then to me. Without another\n",

      "you?” she asked, mistaking my silence for something else.\n",
      "“No,” I grumbled, and then I cleared my throat. “No, I’ll\n",
      "wait.”\n",
      "After the new customers had grabbed their orders and\n",
      "were heading to the empty table, Rose got back to me.\n",
      "“I don’t want to talk about it. I don’t even know why he\n",
      "thought coming here would be a good idea, but I don’t\n",
      "care. I won’t spend a single second talking about him.”\n",
      "“I wasn’t going to say anything,” I lied. “Only…I  don’t\n",
      "want you to talk to him again.” “You’ll hear no arguments from me. Good. So…do you\n",
      "want to wait for a table to open, or do you want to eat with\n",
      "me in the kitchen?”\n",
      "“What do you want to do?”\n",
      "The smile that had been missing ever since Joshua\n",
      "Landon had walked in came back out for me again.\n",
      "“Kitchen. I like having you all to myself .”\n",
      "It was one of the best things I had heard in all my life, if\n",
      "not the absolute best.\n",
      "In the following days, Rose and I never talked about her\n",
      "ex’s sudden appearance, but I did have a private talk with\n",
      "him without her knowledge, for the last time.\n",
      "CHRISTMAS  E VE  WAS nothing special compared to how others\n",
      "celebrated it. It was just the two of us, as neither one of us\n",
      "had family to celebrate it with. There had been an oﬀice\n",
      "party I could’ve taken her to, but she wasn’t completely\n",
      "back to herself yet, she still got headaches if she skipped\n",
      "her medicine, and I didn’t want her on her feet for more\n",
      "than a few hours.\n",
      "As a last minute surprise, I brought in a small Christmas\n",
      "tree and enough ornaments to decorate the whole damn\n",
      "house if we wanted. It was a tradition I wanted to share\n",
      "with her. The smile that bloomed on her face when she saw\n",
      "me and Steve hauling the tree into the apartment was\n",
      "priceless. Her laughter that rung through the apartment as\n",
      "we decorated it together made it one of the best days of my\n",
      "life.\n",
      "So, it was just us in front of the TV after we cooked\n",
      "together and then ate together . She fell asleep with her\n",
      "head on my shoulder around nine PM, twenty minutes into\n",
      "the movie she had picked for us to watch. When it ended, I\n",
      "woke her up with a kiss on her neck. She walked in front of me all the way up the stairs, and I\n",
      "followed. We were both quiet. I shoved my hands in my\n",
      "pockets and stood in front of her door as she leaned back\n",
      "against the wall.\n",
      "Neither of us wanted to say goodbye, so we stood there,\n",
      "looking into each other’s  eyes and waiting for the other to\n",
      "do or say something that would keep us together longer .\n",
      "“It was a good day . I really enjoyed cooking with you.”\n",
      "“You didn’t cook, Rose. You sat on the counter and stole\n",
      "my carrots and roasted potatoes.”\n",
      "“But you fed them to me yourself .”\n",
      "“You stole more than what I gave you.”\n",
      "“I shared my roasted chestnuts with you.”\n",
      "I nodded and my eyes fell to her lips. “ You did.”\n",
      "“So do you want to make it a regular thing?”\n",
      "“You mean where I cook for you and you steal from my\n",
      "preparations?”\n",
      "She grinned and nodded enthusiastically .\n",
      "“Sure. Why not.”\n",
      "We stared at each other for a few seconds. I had no idea\n",
      "what she was thinking, but there were a few things\n",
      "crossing my mind.\n",
      "“I should go,” she mumbled, but she didn’t make a move\n",
      "to leave. “Merry Christmas, Jack Hawthorne.” She leaned\n",
      "up, placed her hand on my chest, and softly kissed  my lips.\n",
      "It was over in three seconds. It was over too soon.\n",
      "“Merry Christmas, Rose Hawthorne.” Then it was my\n",
      "turn to kiss her . It maybe lasted ﬁve, six seconds.\n",
      "“Good night Jack.” She leaned up again, and we went for\n",
      "another kiss as I tried to hide my smile and kiss her back at\n",
      "the same time. On this round, she let her tongue tangle\n",
      "with mine and cupped my cheek. When I opened my eyes,\n",
      "hers were still closed. She sighed and licked her lips. They\n",
      "were already red. They were perfect.\n",
      "I smiled down at her , but she missed it. She ﬁsted my sweater with one hand and dropped her\n",
      "forehead to my chest. My smile widened and I wrapped one\n",
      "of my hands around her waist, using the other to tilt her\n",
      "chin up.\n",
      "“What are you thinking, Rose?”\n",
      "She let out a long breat h and then grimaced. “That I\n",
      "really want you.”\n",
      "I arched an eyebrow , the admission coming out of\n",
      "nowhere and kicking me in the stomach.\n",
      "“And we are married, but we haven’t even gone out on a\n",
      "real, oﬀicial date yet. I really want to have sex with you, but\n",
      "I’m not allow ed to do that yet. I feel like everything  is going\n",
      "the wrong way with us. It’s all backward, and it’s\n",
      "frustrating the hell out of me.”\n",
      "“You want to have sex with me?” I asked, still stuck on\n",
      "that. Evidently we were thinking the same thing. She didn’t\n",
      "realize I’d taken a step forward and she was now backed up\n",
      "against the wall.\n",
      "“Really , really bad.”\n",
      "My heart hammering in my chest, I leaned my head\n",
      "down and whispered in her ear . “Tell me how bad.”\n",
      "She arched away from my lips, and I noticed the goose\n",
      "bumps on the skin of her arms. Mirroring me, she put her\n",
      "hands on my neck and pulled me down to her so she could\n",
      "whisper back. “I don’t think I can put it into words, Jack.”\n",
      "It struck me that even though we were alone in this big\n",
      "apartment, we were acting like we were quickly running\n",
      "out of space . It was just the two of us, yet still we were\n",
      "whispering as if we wanted to make sure no one could hear\n",
      "our thoughts.\n",
      "No one could hear our wants.\n",
      "No one but us. W e didn’t want to share anything.\n",
      "We wanted it to be just us.\n",
      "Rose and Jack.\n",
      "“Your suits make me go crazy. Your frown?” She let out a\n",
      "small groan and pulled me down farther until her lips were grazing my ear with each word out of her mouth. “Your\n",
      "frown kills me, Jack. Every time you frown, it does things to\n",
      "me, and then you roll up your sleeves and I feel like I’m\n",
      "watching porn speciﬁcally made for my eyes. You kiss me…\n",
      "you kiss me and you’re not a turtle anymore. Y ou’re so good\n",
      "at it that whenever you kiss me, whenever I think about you\n",
      "kissing me, I get so wet and I don’t want to stop. I don’t\n",
      "ever want to stop kissing you.”\n",
      "“Rose,” I growled, my cock already hard.\n",
      "My arm still around her waist, I pulled her ﬂush against\n",
      "my body. Her shoulders still pressed against the wall, she\n",
      "arched her back and kept whispering into my ear .\n",
      "“That’s not even half of it, Jack Hawthorne. Whenever\n",
      "we’re walking somewhere or just walking next to each\n",
      "other , you always put your hand on the small of my back,\n",
      "and even that little gesture turns me on. I get the goose\n",
      "bumps just because you’re touching me.”\n",
      "My hand was resting at the small of her back, so I curled\n",
      "my ﬁngers, bunching her soft sweater until I heard her\n",
      "gasp. I nuzzled her cheek and she moved her hands from\n",
      "my neck up into my hair, keeping me in place. We were\n",
      "both breathin g hard and when I took her lips, our kiss was\n",
      "nothing like the innocen t ones we had shared just a few\n",
      "minutes earlier . We both took from each other , our tongues\n",
      "ravenous, our lust unending.\n",
      "When I swallowed her groan, I put my hand right under\n",
      "her ass and she lifted her legs, one by one, wrapping them\n",
      "around my hips. After I was sure she wouldn’t drop them, I\n",
      "put one of my hands behind her head so she wouldn’t get\n",
      "hurt and crushed us into the wall, my cock pressing right\n",
      "between her legs.\n",
      "She turned her head away , her breathing almost as\n",
      "ragged as mine. I kissed and nipped her, tracing along her\n",
      "jawline and neck and then gently sucking on her skin. She\n",
      "moved her hips and I had to push harder into her so she\n",
      "couldn’t, which didn’t help at all. My control was shot to hell, and I was afraid if she rolled her hips one more time, I\n",
      "would have no choice but to take her—to hell with what the\n",
      "doctor said.\n",
      "“Jack.” She moaned my name as if she had done so her\n",
      "entire life, and I buried my head in her neck so I could at\n",
      "least try to control my breathing.\n",
      "“Stop talking,” I ordered.\n",
      "She didn’t listen. I didn’t think she ever listened to me.\n",
      "“You feel so good against me,” she whispered, sliding\n",
      "her temple against mine, adding more fuel to my ﬁre.\n",
      "Involuntarily , I rocked my hips, and her moan spurred\n",
      "me on. She was in my arms, I could smell her need, could\n",
      "smell her skin, and I still couldn’t have her, not yet. Seemed\n",
      "like this was my life story when it came to her .\n",
      "“How many months since the surgery?” I managed to\n",
      "get out in a hoarse voice.\n",
      "“What?” she asked dazedly .\n",
      "I looked into her eyes and they were already glazed,\n",
      "much like what I expected mine looked like. I took her\n",
      "mouth in another long kiss until I couldn’t remember my\n",
      "own name.\n",
      "“How many months, Rose?”\n",
      "“Not three yet,” she whispered, out of breath. “Not\n",
      "three.”\n",
      "My breaths coming out in short bursts, I press ed my\n",
      "forehead against hers and tried to gain some sort of control\n",
      "back. She didn’t let me.\n",
      "“You bring me ﬂowers every Monday .” She gasped, one\n",
      "arm wrapped around my neck, the other one grasping my\n",
      "hair. “And every time you come in with your arms full of\n",
      "such beautifu l roses, I just want to grab your hand, dump\n",
      "the ﬂowers, and take you into the bathroom in the back so\n",
      "you can…so I can…”\n",
      "“Don’t say another word,” I growled.\n",
      "“Everything you do is starting to drive me crazy . I see\n",
      "you in my dreams and I wake up so frustrated because it feels so real and I can’t have that in the real world. I can’t\n",
      "have you.”\n",
      "I pulle d back, my chest heaving. Hers was too, but I\n",
      "wasn’t sure if my heavy breathing was becaus e of her\n",
      "words or her tongue and taste.\n",
      "“You have me, Rose. You’ve had me the entire time.” She\n",
      "didn’t even know how true my words were.\n",
      "She made a guttural sound in the back of her throat, a\n",
      "frustrated and lust-ﬁlled sound. “I don’t have you. I have\n",
      "nothing. I’m your wife, but I can’t have you.”\n",
      "“Just a little longer ,” I whispered, pressing hard kisses\n",
      "against her lips. “Just a little longer , Rose. Then you’ll have\n",
      "everything and more.”\n",
      "“No. Now . Please.”\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "“Jack.”\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "Groaning, I kissed her, hard, one last time for now, and\n",
      "gently put her back down on her feet. My hand was still\n",
      "protecting the back of her head, so I dropped my forehead\n",
      "against hers and just breathed her air in, trying to calm\n",
      "myself down. Looming over her, invading her space, there\n",
      "was nowhere else I’d have rather been in that moment.\n",
      "“I want you,” she said, her voice so small I could feel\n",
      "something breaking inside me. “I want you more than\n",
      "anything I’ve ever wanted in my life.”\n",
      "“That’s a lot of want. Mrs. Hawthorne.” I cupped her\n",
      "cheeks with my palms and closed my eyes. “I’ve been\n",
      "craving you for so long I don’t know what to do with myself\n",
      "anymore.”\n",
      "She was the ﬁrst to speak after both our breaths had\n",
      "somewhat returned to normal again.\n",
      "“What are you doing on New Year’s? We should do this\n",
      "again.”\n",
      "Despite the painful situation I was in since my cock\n",
      "hadn’t given up that easily , I laughed and took a step back. “I’m spendin g it with my beautiful Rose,” I said, and\n",
      "then I ﬁnally walked away .\n",
      "AFTER  SPENDING ten minutes out on the terrace in the\n",
      "freezing cold, I’d just lain down on the bed when my phone\n",
      "pinged.\n",
      "Rose:  Are you awake?\n",
      "Jack:  Yes.\n",
      "Rose:  Me too . Thanks for asking.\n",
      "Jack:  Rose.\n",
      "Rose:  Fine. Y ou need to sleep with me.\n",
      "Jack:  Rose.\n",
      "Rose:  You don’t have to Rose me. I don’t mean like that.\n",
      "Ever since the hospital, I’ve wanted to ask you to stay with\n",
      "me. I got used to it back in the hospital, got used to\n",
      "sleeping next to you, but when you didn’t get in bed with\n",
      "me the ﬁrst night we were back…\n",
      "Rose:  I couldn’t ask. Now I’m asking.\n",
      "I didn’t feel the need to write anything back.\n",
      "She didn’t realize she wouldn’t have had to ask me every\n",
      "day. Once would’ve been enough. I didn’t intend to spend\n",
      "my nights in a diﬀerent bed than she was in.\n",
      "Getting up from the bed, I opened my door and came\n",
      "face to face with my Rose.\n",
      "“Hi, fancy seeing you here. My room or yours?” she\n",
      "asked as if this was completely normal.\n",
      "I sighed and shook my head. “Let’s go to yours then.”\n",
      "As soon as she was in bed, she turned to watch me.\n",
      "Lifting the other end of the covers, I got in after her. She\n",
      "settled on her back and stared at the ceiling. I was in the same position , the only diﬀerence being that\n",
      "she had two pillows to keep her head high during the night\n",
      "and I only had one. Raisin g my right arm, I put it under my\n",
      "head and rested my left hand on my stomach.\n",
      "“We’re going to sleep,” Rose said.\n",
      "“Yes,” I agreed. “We’re only going to sleep. Just like we\n",
      "did at the hospital.”\n",
      "“Yes,” she echoed in a small voice.\n",
      "Seconds passed in silence.\n",
      "She scooted an inch closer and turned onto her side,\n",
      "tucking her hands under  her face. She had gotte n the go-\n",
      "ahead from the doctor to sleep on her side just the week\n",
      "before, and she’d been over the moon about it for two full\n",
      "days.\n",
      "“Jack?”\n",
      "Closing my eyes, I sighed. Her bed smelled like her, her\n",
      "pillow smelled like her, the room smelled like her, and she\n",
      "was too close to stay away for too long—not that I wanted\n",
      "to, but more like had to .\n",
      "“Hmmm.”\n",
      "“We didn’t sleep this far apart at the hospital.”\n",
      "“That was a small bed— I didn’t have anywhere else to\n",
      "go.”\n",
      "“Why would you want to go anywhere else?”\n",
      "Great question.\n",
      "She scooted even closer . Then, before I could do\n",
      "anything about it, she rolled over and gave me her back,\n",
      "ﬁtting hersel f against the length of my body. I rolled over\n",
      "and threw my arm over her stomach, tucking my hand\n",
      "under her waist, keeping her as close as possible.\n",
      "Around her , there was no concept of self -control.\n",
      "I hid my face in her neck and breathed her in.\n",
      "“This is better?”\n",
      "“It’s perfect. Thank you.”\n",
      "A few minutes passed in silence then she was back at me\n",
      "again. “Jack? Are you asleep?”\n",
      "I sighed, sure there woul d be no sleeping in my future. I\n",
      "didn’t mind it at all.\n",
      "She grabbed my hand and placed my palm on her\n",
      "stomach. Her shirt had ridden up, and my hand connected\n",
      "with her hot, smooth skin. She didn’t take her hand away .\n",
      "“Rose,” I groaned.\n",
      "“You can say it as many  times as you want, Jack,” she\n",
      "whispered. “I love your voice, so please keep going.”\n",
      "Smiling, I kissed her neck and pressed my forehead\n",
      "against the back of her head. “You have no idea what you\n",
      "do to me, do you?”\n",
      "I had made sure to keep  my hips away from hers, but\n",
      "she moved her lower body back until her butt was nestled\n",
      "against my hard cock.\n",
      "“I can feel it.”\n",
      "It wasn’t just my cock, though—it was everything. She\n",
      "was wreaking havoc everywhere.\n",
      "Her hand still on top of mine, she started to push it\n",
      "down, and when my ﬁngers touched the edge of her\n",
      "panties, I pressed my hand harder into her stomach and\n",
      "stopped the descent. When had she taken oﬀ her leggings?\n",
      "How had I not noticed it before?\n",
      "“What are you doing, Rose?”\n",
      "“Nothing. You showed me yours and I’m showing you\n",
      "mine.”\n",
      "“What are you talking about?” I whispered, my ﬁngers\n",
      "digging into her soft skin.\n",
      "In the name of getting closer , she backed up into me,\n",
      "making her meaning clearer .\n",
      "I was dying to touch her, so when she pushed harder on\n",
      "my hand, I didn’t have a good enough reason to stop her a\n",
      "second time.\n",
      "Holding my breath, I let her move my hand to wherever\n",
      "she wanted. She was having mercy on me—eithe r that or\n",
      "she wanted to torture me. Instead of pushing my hand under her panties, she lifted her leg just slightly and\n",
      "pushed until my hand was resting right over where I\n",
      "wanted to bury myself deep. Her panties were soaked. She\n",
      "was soaked, for me.\n",
      "I closed my eyes tighter . I couldn’t stop myself from\n",
      "wanting more, not when we were like this.\n",
      "“Don’t you want me, Jack?” she whispered into the dark\n",
      "room, and it broke the hold I had over myself .\n",
      "I gripped her ruined panties in a tight hold and just\n",
      "ripped them oﬀ of her .\n",
      "Her little gasp of shock did nothing but spur me on.\n",
      "“Don’t I want you?” I asked, my voice raw and harsh.\n",
      "Tossing the now completely ruined panties aside, I placed\n",
      "my hand back on her sensitive skin. Resting the heel of my\n",
      "hand on her mound, I let my ﬁngers part her folds and just\n",
      "lazily ran them up and down in her slickness.\n",
      "“Happy now?” I asked, harsher than I expected.\n",
      "“Are you scowling at me?”\n",
      "“Are you making fun of me?”\n",
      "“Never ,” she whispered, pushing her top leg back and\n",
      "over mine, opening herself up to me, letting me have what I\n",
      "was craving. “I love it when you scowl at me.”\n",
      "I nipped her neck, dragging my teeth over her skin. She\n",
      "shivered, causing her butt to push harder against my hips.\n",
      "“I won’t fuck you, Rose . I won’t give you more  than\n",
      "this.” I found  her clit and moved the tip of my ﬁnger around\n",
      "it, barely grazing.\n",
      "“I’ll take it,” she gasped out. “Whatever you can give, I’ll\n",
      "take it.”\n",
      "“What do you want then? T ell me.”\n",
      "“You—I want you.”\n",
      "My ﬁngers stopped moving and I cupped her .\n",
      "She turned her head, her shoulders almost ﬂat on the\n",
      "bed, and looked into my eyes. She was halfway there; I\n",
      "could see it in her gaze,  in what I could make out of her\n",
      "ﬂushed cheeks. I pushed two of my ﬁngers inside her and her body tightened, eyes falling closed. God, she was slick,\n",
      "so slick and tight.\n",
      "“I want to feel your lips against mine, Jack,” she\n",
      "whispered.\n",
      "I closed the distance between us but didn’t kiss her.\n",
      "“The way you kiss me makes me lose my mind,” I\n",
      "whispered back. I wasn’t  even sure if my words had been\n",
      "audible or in my head, but my lips were against hers and I\n",
      "was only a man. I pulled my ﬁngers out and plunged them\n",

      "mouth where I wanted it, but my hand was busy between\n",
      "her legs and I had already lost my head.\n",
      "When her ﬁngers grasped my forearm in an unforgiving\n",
      "grip, her ﬁngernails biting into my skin, I knew she was\n",
      "getting close r, and it hadn’t even been a minute yet. I\n",
      "curved my ﬁngers up and found the spot that caused her to\n",
      "kiss me deeper and harder , the spot that made her groans\n",
      "wilder . I responded back in kind, lost in everything  that was\n",
      "Rose.\n",
      "She was a mess down there, her wetness running down\n",
      "my ﬁngers. She widened her legs, giving me more room to\n",
      "play with her . My thumb found her clit and I pressed hard.\n",
      "She wrenched her mouth away from me, panting. “Keep\n",
      "them in,” she moaned. “Please, not yet. Just keep your\n",
      "ﬁngers in me. Deeper , please.”\n",
      "I pressed as far as my ﬁngers would go, which was deep .\n",
      "I listen ed to the sounds she made, mesmerized —how\n",
      "could I not? Why would I not?\n",
      "“My brain is tingling,” she murmured, clearly half out of\n",
      "it.\n",
      "I was moving my ﬁngers in her in small, light\n",
      "movements but stopped at her words.\n",
      "“Rose we sh— ” She covered my hand with hers before I could think or\n",
      "gather the strength to pull out. “If you stop, I’ll kill you in\n",

      "“You’re a vicious little thing, aren’t you? And all mine.”\n",
      "I took her begging lips and fucked her with my ﬁngers\n",
      "like I couldn ’t fuck her with my cock. I was still being as\n",
      "gentle as I could, but I went as deep as possible, and her\n",
      "body got tighter and tighter against me.\n",
      "And when she came…\n",
      "God, when she came it was the most beautiful thing I’d\n",
      "ever seen in my life. Her little gasps and moans were killing\n",
      "me, but I took them all from her until the only things heard\n",
      "in the room were our labored breaths and the sound her\n",
      "now even more soaked pussy was making.\n",
      "Her body slowly melting in my arms, she twisted her\n",
      "upper body toward me, held my head, and kissed me in\n",
      "slow, maddening nips. Her hips were still twitch ing as I\n",
      "pulled my ﬁngers out and wiped my hand on the sheets.\n",
      "When she turned completely , I hauled her up against me\n",
      "and renewed the kiss until we were on the verge of passing\n",
      "out.\n",
      "We rested our foreheads together , just breathing. Hard.\n",
      "“How is your head?” I managed to ask.\n",
      "“Perfect.”\n",
      "“Are you sure?”\n",
      "“Yep. Thank you, Jack. If you hadn’t given me that, I\n",
      "think I was going to die.”\n",
      "I was dying  a slow death so I understood what she\n",
      "meant.\n",
      "Her hand sneaked in between us, right under my\n",
      "pajamas. I didn’t intend to stop her. I didn’t have the\n",
      "strength anymore. Her palm brushed the slick head of my cock and she ran\n",
      "it up and down my length, her eyes boring into mine. She\n",
      "bit the edge  of her lip, and I could do nothing but stare.\n",
      "Was she really mine? W as she really my wife?\n",
      "“Take me out,” I whispered, and she hurried to obey,\n",
      "using her other hand to pull my pajamas down.\n",

      "care of .\n",
      "“You’re not gonna try to stop me?” she asked.\n",
      "“What’s the point? You never listen to me and we\n",

      "try to resist you.”\n",
      "“Are you saying you can’t resist me?”\n",
      "“I haven’t been able to so far .”\n",
      "She nuzzled her nose against mine and breathed out my\n",
      "name. “ Jack…I want you in me.”\n",
      "I grasped her head and pressed a hard kiss on her\n",
      "forehead. “No .”\n",
      "Her grip on me tightened, her ﬁngers not quite\n",
      "connecting with her thumb.\n",
      "“Be rough,” I hissed.\n",
      "There was a ﬁre burning in her eyes, and I couldn’t have\n",
      "looked away even if I’d wanted to .\n",
      "“Is that how you’re going to fuck me? Rough and deep?”\n",
      "“If that’s how you like it, yes—as deep as I can get.” She\n",
      "moved her tight grip all the way to the base and then\n",
      "moved all the way up to the top agonizingly slowly . After\n",
      "the second tug, she tried to slip under the covers, but I\n",
      "stopped her . “No .”\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "“As much as I’d love to have your mouth on me, you\n",

      "“You’re killing me, Jack Hawthorne.”\n",
      "“You already  killed me when you came all over my\n",
      "hands. W e’ll call it even.” Her tug danced on the edge of being painful and I loved\n",
      "it. She picked up her pace, staring straight into my eyes.\n",
      "“I can’t wait to be in you,” I whispered, holding her head\n",
      "in my hands.  “I can’t wait to take you in any way I can, to\n",

      "satisﬁed and make you moan and cry out my name. I can’t\n",
      "wait, Rose. I can’t wait to have you, to push into you and\n",
      "feel you come around me.”\n",
      "She groaned. “ We should do it now .”\n",
      "“No. You’re gonna love it. I’ll make sure of it.” My eyes\n",
      "on hers, I whispered, “Faster , Rose. Just like that. Come on.\n",
      "Make me come.”\n",
      "She slowed down, her thumb brushed the head, and my\n",
      "eyes dropped closed.\n",
      "“I want to taste you so badly .”\n",
      "“One more month,” I forced out. “One more month and\n",
      "I’ll let you.”\n",
      "With slow but sharp thrusts, I started to thrust into her\n",
      "hold, and suddenly she wrapped both her hands around me\n",
      "to keep her grip tighter .\n",
      "“Yes,” I hissed out then dragged my lips along her jaw.\n",
      "She turned her head and started another kiss. I sucked on\n",
      "her tongue and kept moving my hips. Ending the kiss, she\n",
      "kept her already glazed eyes on me, watching me intently\n",
      "as I asked, “Do you want me to come?”\n",
      "She hummed in her throat and nodded.\n",
      "“Yeah? Keep going,” I moaned, already on edge. I\n",
      "wrapped my hand around  hers and she dropped the other\n",
      "one. I slowed down our strokes, making our grasp tighter\n",
      "and pulling harder . A second later, I came all over her\n",
      "stomach with a loud groan, and it was more than I’d ever\n",
      "come. I let go of my cock as soon as I was done, but she\n",
      "didn’t. She kept her strokes light until I had to pull her\n",
      "hand away because instea d of losing my size, I was starting\n",
      "to get hard again. “I think you’ve had enough of that,” I whispered against\n",
      "her lips.\n",
      "“I don’t think I’ll ever have enough of that.” She let me\n",
      "breathe in and out in silence for a moment as I caught my\n",

      "Jack.”\n",
      "My countdown had already started. ICHAPTER TWENTY-THREE\n",

      "t had been two months and twenty-ﬁve days since my\n",
      "surgery , and it was a Friday .\n",
      "So, we had ﬁnally reached the end of three months.\n",
      "Some days I’d thought we’d never get to see the day, and\n",
      "I’d told Jack exactly that. I’d never in my life told another\n",
      "guy I wanted to have sex with them as much as I’d told\n",
      "Jack. In the beginning, I had thought my constant pressure\n",
      "was aﬀecting  him and he’d soon fold, but nope. Jack was\n",
      "nothing if not in control of his emotions.\n",
      "He had slept right next to me every night without me\n",
      "having to ask for it again . If I went to bed earlier than him,\n",
      "he always found his way into my bed, but he hadn’t touched\n",
      "me the way I was dying for him to touch me again. He said\n",
      "no and nothing else.\n",
      "I came back down to earth when Sally snapped her\n",
      "ﬁngers in front of my face.\n",
      "“Are you here?”\n",
      "“Yes. Yes, sorry . I just got distracted. What were you\n",
      "saying about Owen again?”\n",
      "Owen was currently in the kitchen so there was no way\n",
      "for him to hear us, but Sally still leaned in closer . “I think\n",
      "he likes me.”\n",
      "“I thought he wasn’t talking to you.”\n",
      "“Technically he isn’t.” I laughed. “ Your logic scares me sometimes.”\n",
      "A couple walked in hand in hand so we had to break up\n",
      "our little gossip bubble. Suddenly , I wasn’t so sure if it had\n",
      "been a good idea to give the go-ahead to Sally about Owen.\n",
      "I kinda felt sorry for him.\n",
      "As I got the orders of the newcomers and cut two pieces\n",
      "of apple pie for them, Sally prepared one cappuccino and\n",
      "one macchiato . They picked up their orders and sat down at\n",
      "the last table available in the left part of the coﬀee shop.\n",
      "“I’m thinking of getting two or three more tables. Most\n",
      "days we barely have any space left, and I think  we can\n",
      "easily squeeze in three more—one more on this side, maybe\n",
      "even two, and another two on the other side.”\n",
      "Sally leaned her elbows on the counter , humming. “I\n",
      "think you’re right. Ever since that blogger posted about us\n",
      "on Instagram, we’ve started getting even more customers,\n",
      "and even if they don’t come in, they keep taking photos\n",
      "outside the front door .”\n",
      "Right then the bell chimed and our heads turned that\n",
      "way.\n",
      "“Jack!” I called out, perhaps a little too enthusiastically ,\n",
      "and he paused in the doorway . Half of the customers who\n",
      "didn’t have their earbuds in turned to look at me.\n",
      "Ignoring Sally’s snort and chuckle, I gave the customers\n",
      "an apologetic smile and rushed to Jack’s side as he closed\n",
      "the door and met me halfway . I was half running, half\n",
      "trying to appear like I wasn’t running at all, and he was just\n",
      "walking, in no hurry .\n",
      "“What’s going on?” he asked with an arched eyebrow\n",
      "and a suspic ious look around the coﬀee shop. Even that\n",
      "look and that lifted brow turned me on. To be hone st, lately ,\n",
      "everything Jack did turned me on. He’d give me a look, a\n",
      "strong look that said he didn’t ﬁnd me amusing at all, and\n",
      "I’d become a puddle on the ground. It was becoming a\n",
      "thing for me. “Come, come.” I reached for his hand and when he\n",
      "linked our ﬁngers togeth er, my smile turned up a notch,\n",
      "making me look like an idiot. I didn’t mind it at all.\n",
      "“Hello, Sally ,” Jack said as I took him behind the counter .\n",
      "Still with that knowing grin on her face, Sally waved at\n",
      "him. She thought I’d scored with Jack. I thought so too .\n",
      "“He’s going to steal me for a few minutes,” I told Sally\n",
      "then pulled him to the back.\n",
      "“Who said I wanted to steal you?” Jack murmured into\n",

      "“I’m saying it because you should  want to steal me—all\n",

      "husband.”\n",
      "Owen looked  up from the paper he was scribbling on\n",
      "and straightened up. “Hey , man.”\n",
      "Jack nodded and they formally shook hands. For some\n",
      "reason, he hadn’t warmed up to Owen yet.\n",
      "I leaned against Jack’s arm, our hands still tightly\n",
      "clasped. “Can he have a minute alone with me, Owen? I\n",
      "told him a million times that it’s not appropria te in the\n",
      "coﬀee shop, but he just looks at me…” I peered up at Jack\n",
      "and looked at his frowny face with a happy heart. “Just like\n",
      "that. You see that frown?  So yeah, I can’t resist him when\n",
      "he is glowering at me. Plus, Sally might need help if\n",
      "someone comes in.”\n",
      "Owen didn’t even blink at my statement. “Yeah, sure.”\n",
      "He picked up the paper he was working on—another list.\n",

      "“Who said I didn’t like him?”\n",

      "“He gets to spend entire days with you in here.”\n",
      "“So?”\n",
      "“I don’t,” he grumbled, leaning down, his mouth entirely\n",
      "too close to mine.\n",
      "“Jack?” I whispered, my nose bumping his. “Hmm.”\n",
      "“That might be the sweetest thing you’ve ever said to\n",
      "me. Let’s go crazy in the back—we have to after that\n",
      "comment.”\n",
      "He straightened up, taking that beautiful mouth  away\n",
      "and giving me a blank look. “No .”\n",
      "I pulled Jack forward and stopped with my back against\n",
      "the island.\n",
      "“At least give me a lift up, or is that too much touching\n",
      "for you?”\n",
      "His lips twitching, he shook his head. “Always ordering\n",
      "me around,” he murmure d as he put his hands around my\n",
      "waist. I had instant goose bumps when he lifted me up on\n",
      "the island, and I pulled him between my legs.\n",
      "My hands grabbing the lapels of his jacket, I pulle d him\n",
      "closer and pressed my forehead against his. “Hi. How are\n",
      "you? I missed you.”\n",
      "His hands squeezed my waist once, moving down  to my\n",
      "hips, sliding me an inch or two forward. “You saw me a few\n",
      "hours ago when I dropped you oﬀ this morning.”\n",
      "“I know . It’s been ages.” He gave me that precious smile\n",
      "I couldn’t get enough of and my own lips mirrored his. “And\n",
      "you’re suppo sed to say you missed me too. That’s what\n",
      "husbands say .”\n",
      "He hummed, and the warm sound traveled all over my\n",
      "body. “Is that what I’m supposed to say?” His hand made its\n",
      "way down my thigh and he unwrapped my leg from his\n",
      "waist, which I hadn’t even realized I had placed there…kind\n",
      "of. His face softened and he cupped my cheek. “You look a\n",
      "little tired.”\n",
      "I scooted forward a bit to make up for the unwrap ping. I\n",
      "wanted to be as close as possible. “You know how much I\n",
      "love it when you compliment me on how good I look. Tell\n",
      "me more.”\n",
      "He pulled back and gave  me a pointed look that pretty\n",
      "much said he wasn’t having it. I hauled him back. “I’m ﬁne. I promise I sit down before\n",
      "I get dizzy, and I’m sitting right now too. I haven’t baked a\n",
      "thing either . Would you like to know what else good\n",
      "husbands do?”\n",
      "“Good husbands,” he mumbled, his hands moving up\n",
      "and down on my back. I did my best not to squirm.\n",
      "“They kiss their wives when they see them.”\n",
      "“They do?”\n",
      "“Yeah. I’m told it’s a tradition.”\n",
      "He licked his lips, and because I was trying to fuse\n",
      "myself to him, his tongue touched my lips too. Letting go of\n",
      "his jacket before I could wrinkle it too much, I wrapped my\n",
      "arms around his neck, already having trouble remembering\n",
      "how to breathe like a normal person.\n",
      "“Good thing I’m not your real husband then,” Jack said.\n",
      "My mouth dropped open  and I let go of him, feigning\n",
      "shock. “ Jack Hawthorne, did you just make a joke?”\n",
      "“Smartass,” he muttered with a smile, his eyes dancing.\n",
      "It seemed I was making him happy . Every time he smiled it\n",
      "loosened something in me.\n",
      "“You may kiss me now,” I whispered, ready for it,\n",
      "desperate and impatient for it, and then he ﬁnally  did so. I\n",
      "quickly wrapped my arms back around him again and\n",
      "gladly returned his kiss. Unfortunately , he put a stop to it in\n",
      "no time.\n",
      "“Hello, my beautiful wife,” he whispered, and I felt a\n",
      "little better since he was out of breath too . It wasn’t just me\n",
      "who was aﬀected.\n",
      "I heard the bell chime and more chatter trickled into our\n",
      "private little bubble. We weren’t alone, though I kept\n",
      "forgetting that when he was around.\n",
      "“That’s slightly better ,” I commented, my hands on his\n",
      "shoulders.\n",
      "“Are you ready?” he asked.\n",
      "“I’m buying new tables,” I announced instead of\n",
      "responding to his question. He frowned. “ What?”\n",
      "“New tables—we need them. We’re always full and we\n",
      "have the space too, so I’m buying new tables.”  I smiled\n",
      "widely . “Yay!”\n",
      "“That’s good, baby , but—”\n",
      "That word, that baby —hearing it for the ﬁrst time from\n",

      "his voice that just added to the endearment. I’d never even\n",
      "considered that I would love to be called baby , but this…\n",
      "this speciﬁc one coming from  this speciﬁc guy, it stopped\n",
      "me in my tracks. I could’ve spent the rest of my life just\n",
      "being called baby by Jack Hawthorne.\n",
      "“Hmmm,” I moaned in the hopes of distracting him. I\n",
      "leaned in and nuzzled his nose with my own, whispering\n",
      "against his lips, “Should I even let you know how much I\n",
      "love your voice? Or the way my name sounds when it comes\n",
      "from your lips?” I gently  kissed his top lip then his lower\n",
      "lip, and then I went in for a deeper kiss, searchin g for his\n",
      "tongue. “That baby  just about killed me, Jack.”\n",
      "“You’re trying to distract me,” he muttered, and I smiled\n",
      "because it was exactly what I was doing and it was working\n",
      "perfectly . I tilted my head to the side and took a big breath\n",
      "before going in again.\n",
      "No one had ever kissed me like Jack Hawthorne did, and\n",
      "I didn’t think I ever wanted to ﬁnd out if there was anyone\n",
      "else out there who could.\n",
      "“Why would  I do that?” I whispered, my lips still\n",
      "touching his. I bit my lip. “Don’t get angry , I’m not saying\n",
      "we should act on it, but I really want you, Jack. Just so you\n",
      "know .”\n",
      "I felt his smile against my mouth and then his warm\n",
      "chuckle. The sound made my heart sigh in happiness.\n",
      "“Really? I had no idea. You only say and text it every day,\n",
      "a couple times a day .”\n",
      "“And you never say it, or text it, or do it.”\n",
      "“Because I can control myself .” I kisse d him again, takin g it slow, coaxing him. “You’re\n",

      "He smiled into our kiss, nipping at my lips.\n",
      "I leane d forward until my lips were right next to his ear.\n",
      "“But I want to hear you say you want me. Tell me you want\n",
      "me, Jack. A t least give me that much.”\n",
      "I drew  back and looked into his eyes. I could see the\n",
      "sparkle in his beautiful deep blues.\n",
      "“You think I don’t want you?”\n",
      "Keeping my eyes on his, I slowly shrugged. His jaw\n",
      "clenched and he looked toward the doorway wher e I could\n",
      "hear Sally steaming milk and Owen talking to a customer . I\n",
      "didn’t care about where we were, not really , not when I was\n",
      "with Jack. Whenever he was around me, I felt like I was on\n",
      "top of the world, and the fact that he always brushed me oﬀ\n",
      "because he was genuinely worried about my health only\n",
      "intensiﬁed my need for him. I didn’t think he was\n",
      "indiﬀerent at all, but I liked pushing him. I especi ally liked\n",

      "husband, Sally walked in on us.\n",
      "“Rose, do you think you could—oh, I’m sorry . Sorry . Ah,\n",
      "I’ll wait out here.”\n",
      "I rested my head on Jack’s shoulder and groaned.\n",
      "He cleared his throat and tilted my chin up. “We need to\n",

      "“But I thought today—”\n",
      "He arched an eyebrow . “I reminded you just this\n",
      "morning, before you ran out of the car, so don’t try to act\n",
      "like you don’t know what I’m talking about. They scheduled your MRI and your antibiotic shot for today . We need to be\n",
      "there in an hour .”\n",
      "I cupp ed his face with both my hands. It was on the tip\n",
      "of my tongue  to tell him I loved him, and I didn’t even know\n",
      "where the thought had come from. I knew I was falling for\n",
      "him, but I hadn’t realized I was already there. “Okay . All\n",
      "jokes aside, I love that you’re taking care of me,” I said\n",
      "seriously . “I’ve never had that before. I’m sorry if I’m\n",
      "pushing you too much. You know I never really had family ,\n",
      "but you—”\n",
      "He kissed me, a quick and hard and ﬁerce kiss. “What\n",
      "am I? Chopp ed liver? You could never push me too much.\n",
      "Don’t ever stop pushing me.”\n",
      "I smile d and let him put me down back on my feet. “I’ll\n",

      "“I’m sorry , Rose.”\n",

      "“I know you don’t want the MRI, but they need to see if\n",
      "everything looks okay . I need to know if everything is okay .”\n",
      "I walked back to him and rose up on my toes so I could\n",
      "press what was my version of a quick and hard kiss on his\n",
      "lips, and I melted a little when he put his hand on the small\n",
      "of my back and pulled me against his body .\n",
      "“You’ll stay with me again?”\n",
      "“Always.”\n",
      "“Then it’ll be okay. I know I’m being stupid abou t it. It\n",

      "The car ride was fun, and I tried my best to look as if I\n",
      "wasn’t freaki ng out about the fact that I was going back in\n",
      "that casket again. We sat hand in hand the entire time, and\n",
      "Jack even made a comment or two about Raymond’s love\n",
      "life when we were having a very serious talk on that very\n",
      "subject. T oo bad I was too anxious to enjoy it all. But then the MRI scan…it was no better than the ﬁrst\n",
      "time. Even though I was required to lie on my back this\n",
      "time, they still put the cage thing on my head, and this time\n",
      "around I got much dizzier than the ﬁrst time. I had to keep\n",
      "my eyes closed the entire time as I tried to focus only on\n",
      "Jack’s touch on my ankle.  As soon as they took me out and I\n",
      "got rid of the thing on my head, he carried me oﬀ to the\n",
      "small room, and just like the previous time, he let me cry\n",
      "on him for a good two minutes. The last time I’d done that,\n",
      "we hadn’t been real. This time, we were, and it made me\n",
      "feel better because he kissed every drop of my tears away ,\n",
      "stealing more pieces of my heart in the process.\n",
      "“Where do you want me to take you?” Jack asked once\n",
      "we were back in the car .\n",
      "The needle part hadn’t been fun either; it had hurt like\n",
      "hell, which you could easily tell from my ashen face and the\n",
      "hand I kept pressing on my arm. Since my brain had been\n",
      "kind of exposed with the tear, preventing infection was\n",
      "important. That’d been what they kept telling me, so I knew\n",
      "there was no way to get out of it—not that I had tried to get\n",
      "out of it or anything. I’d never .\n",
      "“Rose?”\n",
      "This time, we weren’t sitting so close.\n",
      "I looked at him. “Home. I want to go home. I’ll text Sally\n",

      "want to bring the energy down.”\n",
      "“Okay ,” he said simply and then told Raymond where to\n",
      "take us.\n",
      "Back in the building, Jack said hello to Steve and asked\n",
      "him how he was doing. I couldn’t help it—I cracked my ﬁrst\n",
      "post-MRI smile. To think I’d been the one to tell him what\n",
      "his own doorman’s name was.\n",
      "“How is the kid doing?” I asked, wrapping my arm\n",
      "around Jack’s and standing in front of Steve.\n",
      "“She’s good, back at the new school.”\n",
      "“No more problems I hope.” “So far it’s been okay .”\n",
      "“That’s good.”\n",

      "heartbroken Steve and obviously already knew some about\n",
      "her, we’d only met twice when she had come to visit her\n",
      "father for a few hours. We’d bonded over our love of baking\n",
      "and rain, of all things, because it had been pourin g in New\n",
      "York both days. We’d come up with over twenty-ﬁve\n",
      "reasons why we loved rain and rainy days when I had\n",
      "wandered down from Jack’s apartment because I’d been\n",
      "bored out of my mind just sitting, sitting, sitting.\n",
      "Jack had found me on the ﬂoor with Bella and had taken\n",
      "me back upstairs because  it was ‘cold’ and I wasn’t healthy\n",
      "enough to sit my ass on cold ﬂoors. That had been original,\n",
      "especially hearing the word ass coming from his mouth.\n",
      "“And I adore  her. She is a smart cookie. If it’s okay with\n",
      "you, I’d love it if she could come to my coﬀee shop. Maybe\n",
      "we could bake together if she feels up to it? Then I’d bring\n",
      "her back here, of course.”\n",
      "“You don’t have to do that. I know how busy you are.”\n",
      "“Of course I don’t have  to do it. I want  to. We’ll bake and\n",
      "spend a few hours together . It’ll be fun.”\n",
      "“Thank you, Mrs. Hawthorne. She’ll love that.”\n",
      "Back in the elevator , Jack was the ﬁrst to break our\n",
      "silence. “Doe s he call you Mrs. Hawthorne every time you\n",
      "talk or is it just my presence that changes things?”\n",
      "I gave him a sheepish grin and he just shook his head. “I\n",
      "like the sound of it, though.”\n",
      "“The sound of what?”\n",
      "“Mrs. Hawthorne. I like it when you say it too .” The doors opened to his ﬂoor before he could respond,\n",
      "and we walked into the apartment.\n",
      "All I wanted  to do was go upstairs, take a showe r so I\n",
      "could feel like a normal  human being again, and take a\n",
      "long, long nap. So, that’s  what I decided to go ahead and\n",
      "do. I took oﬀ my shoes next to the door and headed  straight\n",
      "for the stairs.\n",
      "“I’ll jump in the shower and just try to get myself back\n",
      "together .” I turned around and started walking backward,\n",
      "my eyes on Jack. “ Would you like to join me?”\n",
      "“Rose.”\n",
      "One word, my name, which had gained a new meaning\n",
      "lately . It meant no .\n",
      "“I meant for cleaning purposes only, but suit yourself ,\n",
      "buddy . Do you have work  to do? You came to the hospital\n",
      "with me and now you’re here so I’m guessing you need to\n",
      "catch up with things because of me.”\n",
      "“I’ll be in my oﬀice.”\n",
      "“Okay . I’ll come bug you as soon as I’m done.” Waving at\n",
      "him, I ﬁnally turned back around and trotted up the stairs.\n",
      "“Rose?”\n",
      "I looked down at Jack, my husband who was in fact not\n",
      "my husband,  who had held my ankle during the entire MRI\n",
      "scan and then wrapped me in his arms while whispering\n",
      "that I was okay, that we were okay again and again in the\n",
      "privacy of a little hospital room. I didn’t think he\n",
      "understood how much it meant to me. It was getting harder\n",
      "and harder with each passing day to hold myself back and\n",
      "not tell him what I was feeling for him, what I had been\n",
      "feeling for him for quite a while now .\n",
      "“Yes?”\n",
      "“You’re good.”\n",
      "It wasn’t a question. I wasn’t sure if it was a statement\n",
      "or not, either . He wanted  me to be good, so I’d be good, for\n",
      "him, so he’d feel good.\n",
      "I gave him a small smile. “Never better .” “You should try harder—it doesn’t seem to be working.”\n",
      "My smile got bigger and I saluted him, disappearing\n",
      "from his sight.\n",
      "THERE  WAS a small knock on my door before it cracked\n",
      "open. “Rose?”\n",
      "“If you don’t  want to have sex with me don’t come  in,” I\n",
      "warned the only person who could be knocking on my door .\n",
      "Despite my warning, he opened it and stood there in all\n",
      "his glory . Same suit, same everything, face and frown and\n",
      "all.\n",
      "I stood there in my thank fully matching sky blue bra and\n",
      "panties. I was standing with the towel in my hands, and I\n",
      "kept standing  there as his hungry eyes took in every inch of\n",
      "my half-naked body. I had hips, but I liked them. I liked that\n",
      "there was a curve to me, a curve that loved the touch of his\n",
      "hands. While my boobs weren’t anything too spectacular ,\n",
      "Jack didn’t seem to agree. I’d never been happier to have\n",
      "almost C cups as I’d been when I’d caught his eyes on them\n",
      "a time or two. In any case, we stood just like that, him in\n",
      "the doorway with eyes glued to me, me in the middle of the\n",
      "room with my body heating. I didn’t think anyone would\n",
      "describe me as shy, but I felt a touch of heat on my cheeks\n",
      "when the seconds ticked by and Jack didn’t say anything.\n",
      "“Hi?” I managed to croak out.\n",
      "His eyes snapped to me and his jaw hardened, making\n",
      "him even hotter . I truly loved it when his face turned all\n",
      "prickly and frustrated and angry and arrogant and heated\n",
      "and hungry and annoyed and all the things. “Hi,” he forced\n",
      "out.\n",
      "Gulping, I brought the towel I had been using to dry my\n",
      "hair to my front and somewhat tried to conceal my nakedness. It wouldn’t help much with anything because it\n",
      "was only a little bigger than a hand towel.\n",
      "“How can I help you?” I groaned on the inside. Me being\n",
      "horny was all the doctor’ s fault. I’d never in my life asked\n",
      "any of my boyfriends if they were in the mood to have sex,\n",
      "let alone begged someon e to have sex with me as much as\n",
      "I’d begged Jack.\n",
      "There was something about him. Maybe if we had done\n",
      "it once, I would have stopped thinking and talking  about it\n",
      "all the time. Maybe he’d be excruciatingly bad—b ut I knew\n",
      "he wouldn’t be. I knew what he’d do to me, and I couldn’t\n",
      "wait.\n",
      "“Are you free for dinner?” His voice was still tight, as\n",
      "was his grip on the door handle, and that was a question I\n",
      "hadn’t heard in a while.\n",
      "“I’ll have to check my schedule.”\n",
      "I didn’t move. Then I smiled, making my way to him. It\n",
      "wasn’t a seductive smile or anything like that; I wasn’t\n",
      "trying to be sexy at all. I honestly wouldn’t have known how\n",
      "or what to do to begin to seduce a guy like Jack. I’d imagine\n",
      "for a guy like him to be impressed, you’d have to pull out\n",
      "all the stops, maybe do a light striptease as you were\n",
      "walking towa rd him and then just go for it. Or, what would\n",
      "be even better…you’d be so spectacular that he’d just\n",
      "couldn’t stop himself and go for you.\n",
      "He hadn’t gone for me, hence why I kept mentioning it.\n",
      "Basically I was trying to seduce him by badgering him on\n",
      "the subject and hoped he’d get frustrated enough to\n",
      "actually do it just to have me shut up, because I ﬁgured\n",
      "that worked too .\n",
      "I stopped in front of him, looking up at him and smiling.\n",
      "“I checked.”\n",
      "He arched an eyebrow , his eyes not even dipping to my\n",
      "boobs once. I didn’t ﬁnd that reassuring at all. “ And?”\n",
      "“I’m free. I’m free every day .”\n",
      "“Finally . Get ready . We’re going out on a date.” As soon as he got those words out, he took a step back\n",
      "and slammed the door in my face. I stared at the door in\n",
      "shock then broke into happy laughter .\n",
      "I opened the door to see his retreating back.\n",
      "“Our ﬁrst oﬀicial date?” I yelled after him before he\n",
      "could get to the stairs.\n",
      "“Yes,” he yelled back, his voice angry . A shiver worked\n",
      "through my body .\n",
      "“Where are we going? Can I ask?”\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "“Where are you going? Can I at least ask that?”  I was\n",
      "lucky he wasn’t looking back because my face was sporting\n",
      "the most ridiculous smile in the world.\n",
      "“Out,” he snapped, making his way downstairs.\n",
      "“Out? Where are you going? What about our date?”\n",
      "He paused on the last step and ﬁnally looked at me. I\n",
      "was hanging  from the rail, still in my underw ear, face\n",
      "ﬂushed and happy .\n",
      "His gaze was piercing. “I’ll wait for you downstairs.”\n",
      "“But why are you leaving?”\n",
      "“Because you’re pushing me.”\n",
      "My mouth dropped open.\n",
      "“I’m pushing you?” I took a step down the stairs. “I\n",
      "didn’t say a thing.”\n",
      "“Don’t come down here, Rose.”\n",
      "I paused.\n",
      "“I’m pushing you?” I started again. “How about you\n",
      "coming into my room and staring at me like that?”\n",
      "“How did I—never mind. I’m waiting for you downstairs.\n",
      "I don’t trust you.”\n",
      "I started laughing in earnest, so happy , happy , happy . I\n",
      "caught his lip twitch.\n",
      "“Take as much time as you need. I’ll wait for you\n",
      "downstairs.”\n",
      "“Okay . Promise I won’t be long. You can keep Steve\n",
      "company .” “Yes. How did I not think of that? I’ll just go do that.”\n",
      "When I couldn’t see him anymore, I shouted after him\n",
      "from my perch on the stairs. “What should I wear? What\n",
      "kind of date is it?”\n",
      "“It’s a date—what else do you need to know? And I don’t\n",
      "care what you wear as long as you cover yourself up, neck\n",
      "to toe.”\n",
      "I did exactly  that. I wore a black dress that wasn’t too\n",
      "ﬂashy . Short  sleeves, open V neck, a relaxed fabric that\n",
      "gently hugged both my boobs and my hips and ended four\n",
      "or ﬁve inches above my knees. I roughly dried my thick hair\n",
      "and straightened my bangs because I wasn’t interested in\n",
      "getting a cold from walki ng out the door with wet hair on a\n",
      "snowy New York night. I did my makeup, focusing heavily\n",
      "on the eyes. I wore my thick black coat and wrapped my\n",
      "scarf around my neck, also donning my black leather\n",
      "gloves. Grabbing my cream ribbed beret from the top shelf\n",
      "of my closet, I put it on my head and walked out of the\n",
      "apartment in a hurry . I couldn’t exactly run yet because of\n",
      "my brain and nose thing, but I came close to it.\n",
      "My heart jumping in my chest and my tummy ﬁlled with\n",
      "those excited  butterﬂies,  I felt like I was going out on my\n",
      "ﬁrst ever date with a boy I’d had a crush on for years. It\n",
      "was a strange feeling being so excited about a simple date,\n",
      "but this was Jack Hawthorne, my pretend husband who\n",
      "knew how to kiss me exactly the right way. How could I not\n",
      "have been excited?\n",
      "When the elevator doors opened, I forced myself to take\n",
      "smaller steps just in case Jack was waiting for me in the\n",
      "lobby . He wasn’t. I stopped in front of Steve.\n",
      "“How do I look?”\n",
      "He smiled at me and I beamed back at him. “As beautiful\n",
      "as ever .”\n",
      "“Maybe I should tone down the happy a little?”\n",
      "He let out a roar of laughter . “Don’t ever tone down the\n",
      "happy , Rose. It suits you well.” I melted a little at his words. “ You’re the best, Steve.”\n",
      "He inclined his head. “So? What’s the special occasion?”\n",
      "“My husband is taking me out for a date,” I said proudly .\n",
      "“Lucky lady . That’s as special as it gets.”\n",
      "“Oh, you have no idea.”\n",
      "“Mr. Hawthorne said he’ll be waiting for you outside.”\n",
      "“Okay .” I ran my gloved hands down my coat now that\n",
      "there was some unexp ected nervousness trickling in.\n",
      "“Thank you, Steve. I’ll see you later?”\n",
      "“I’ll be right here. Have fun.”\n",
      "Saying a quick goodbye to the kind doorman who had\n",
      "become my friend, I walked out onto the street. It had\n",
      "started snowing again, adding to the snow- and slush-\n",
      "covered sidewalks. I looked up at the skies and closed my\n",
      "eyes, little snowﬂakes melting on my face, tickling me. I\n",
      "smiled. I felt so giddy and free. I looked around to ﬁnd Jack\n",
      "and he was right there, on the left side of the building. He\n",
      "leaned against his car , right next to R aymond, studying me.\n",
      "My heart soared at the sight of him, as it always did\n",
      "lately , and I truly felt like I hadn’t ever felt any happier in\n",
      "my life. I couldn’t help myself—I ran to his side just as he\n",
      "became alert and straightened up. He said something to\n",
      "Raymond and after nodding at Jack, Raymond opened his\n",
      "door and got into the driver’s seat, leaving Jack to me.\n",
      "I stopped right in front of him, just a tad out of breath.\n",
      "He pushed my bangs out of my eyes, the tips of his\n",
      "ﬁngers gently trailing the contours of my face. “You aren’t\n",
      "supposed to run, Rose.”\n",
      "I moved my head up and down, and he sighed as I\n",
      "grinned. “So?”\n",
      "“What am I gonna do with you?”\n",
      "I shrugged. “K eep me?”\n",
      "He reached for my beret and ﬁxed it on my head then,\n",
      "with his hands cupping my face, he leaned down and kissed\n",
      "me. His hands were warm on my cheeks, his lips even\n",
      "warmer and more addictive. I grabbed his wrist s to hold him there just a little longer. When we’d had a taste of each\n",
      "other , not enough of a taste but a small sample, he pulled\n",
      "back and looked into my eyes.\n",
      "“You’re going  to be the death of me,” he said with all the\n",
      "seriousness in the world.\n",
      "And I think I love you , I wanted to say, but instead I gave\n",
      "him my biggest smile.\n",
      "His laughter was everything to me. My eyes and heart\n",
      "warmed just looking at him.\n",
      "He was all mine.\n",
      "“Get in the car .”\n",
      "I repeated his own words  back to him: “Always ordering\n",
      "me around.”\n",
      "He gave me a blank look with an arched eyebrow and I\n",
      "smiled sweet ly. He opened the door and slid in right after\n",
      "me. I rarely  sat on the other end anymore. Usually , he\n",
      "wanted me to be right next to him, and what do you know ,\n",
      "so did I. At that moment,  my thigh was resting against his.\n",
      "We were sitting that close, and I couldn’t have been any\n",
      "happier .\n",
      "I shivered a little once he closed the door, and I ran my\n",
      "hands up and down my arms. “It’s really cold tonight.”\n",
      "One at a time, he picked up my gloved hands and rubbed\n",
      "them between his own.\n",
      "Oh, I really wanted to keep him.\n",
      "The car ride didn’t take long, and when we were\n",
      "dropped oﬀ in front of the cutest little Italian restaurant, I\n",
      "was pleasantly surprised. To be honest, I hadn’t been\n",
      "looking forward to heading to a crowded, fancy place. This\n",
      "place, howev er, was anything but fancy . Jack had my hand\n",
      "in his as we walked down  two steps to enter the restaurant.\n",
      "All the cute little tables had those red checkered\n",
      "tablecloths, every table that was occupied had two small\n",
      "candles burning on it, and I couldn’t wait to get my own\n",
      "candles. Jack talked to the woman who came forward to\n",
      "greet us, and she took us to one of the tables right in front of the big window . At the table right next to us sat a\n",
      "grandpa and his grandson, and they were biting into their\n",
      "ﬁrst slices of pizza.\n",
      "I could  hear my stomach growling. I took oﬀ my gloves\n",
      "ﬁrst then my beret and my scarf , and then ﬁnally my coat.\n",
      "Jack was in the process of pulling my chair back  when he\n",
      "stopped moving. I pressed my lips ﬂat and tried to keep in\n",
      "my smile. He cleared his throat and came unstuck. I sat\n",
      "down, and he took his spot across from me.\n",
      "He looked at me for a long moment before he let out a\n",
      "long breath. “ You take my breath away , Rose Hawthorne.”\n",
      "Whoosh—there went my own breath. That was as real\n",
      "and as perfect as it got. “Is this one of those times?”\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",
      "Clearing my throat, I leaned my elbows on the table and\n",
      "rested my head on my hands. “That’s a good start. Keep\n",
      "going.”\n",
      "He smiled then his eyes slowly dropped to my boobs.\n",
      "Finally!\n",
      "“I thought I told you to cover yourself up, head to toe.”\n",
      "“And I listene d to you,” I agreed easily . “I wore my coat,\n",
      "my scarf, my gloves, my beret. I wore everything I could\n",
      "wear .”\n",
      "“Nice try,” he countered, shaking his head. “It’s freezing\n",
      "out there—you’re gonna get sick.”\n",
      "“I won’t. It’s all cozy and warm and perfect in here.”\n",
      "A kid who barely looked sixteen dropped oﬀ our menus,\n",
      "cutting into our conversation. I dropped my elbows from\n",
      "the table and started checking out the options. The kid next\n",
      "to us was chattering away and making his grandpa laugh,\n",
      "and it just lifted my mood even more. I looked up from the\n",
      "menu and around the restaurant, noticing the other few\n",
      "customers, and I realized we were extremely overdressed.\n",
      "I leaned in toward Jack, and he looked at me quizzically .\n",
      "“Come here,” I whispered.\n",
      "“Why?” He looked so suspicious and adorable in a grumpy way\n",
      "that I had to laugh. “ Just lean in closer .”\n",
      "He did so carefully .\n",
      "“I think we’re a bit overdressed.”\n",
      "His shoulders relaxed before he looked around, and I\n",
      "had to bite my lip to hold in my laughter . Did he think I’d\n",
      "jump on him?\n",
      "“I like it though,” I continued before he had a chance to\n",
      "say anything, and his eyes came back to me. “I feel special.\n",
      "I know this isn’t your usual type of place at all, so I\n",
      "appreciate that you’re doing this for me even more. Thank\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "“You don’t have to thank me, Rose. It’s as much for me\n",
      "as it is for you, and it’s just dinner . It doesn’t matter where\n",
      "we are as long as we’re together .”\n",
      "“Ah, you just killed me, and that’s true. That’s really\n",
      "true.”\n",
      "“I’m still glad you approve.”\n",
      "“Yes, you did well. Y ou might get lucky . Eventually .”\n",
      "Another head shake as he put his menu down. “You\n",
      "don’t give up, do you?”\n",
      "I groaned and hid my face behind my hands. “It’s not\n",
      "me, I promise. It’s the doctor .”\n",
      "“What do you mean it’s the doctor?” He reached out and\n",
      "pulled my hands down as if he couldn’t not have eyes on my\n",
      "face—at least that was what I liked to think.\n",
      "“I do want you, I’m not gonna lie about that, but I’m not\n",
      "like this. I’m never like this. This is only happening because\n",
      "he said…” Looking at the grandpa and grandson next to\n",
      "me, I whispe red, “It’s because he said I can’t have sex.\n",
      "Now I want all the sex. You can’t tell me I can’t do\n",
      "something. Then all I wanna do is…well, it. It’s the allure of\n",
      "the forbidden. Y ou’re not like that?”\n",
      "“You either want something or you don’t. What does\n",
      "what other people say have anything to do with it?”\n",
      "I leaned back. “Of course you’d say that.” “What’s that supposed to mean?”\n",
      "I waved my hand in the air. “You’re…you. You’re very\n",
      "disciplined. I don’t think anyone or anything can aﬀect you.\n",
      "Like you love to say , you can control yourself .”\n",
      "“You aﬀect me.”\n",
      "I smiled. It was a slow and happy one. “You aﬀect me\n",
      "too.”\n",
      "“So, correct me if I’m wrong: if the doctor had said it’s\n",
      "okay to have sex, you—”\n",
      "“Jack!” I snapped, reaching across to put my hand over\n",
      "his mouth.\n",
      "“What?” he muttered.\n",
      "Tilting my head to the side, I gestured to the duo sitting\n",
      "next to us with my eyes.\n",
      "Jack looked up and sighed. I supposed it was his version\n",
      "of asking for deliverance.\n",
      "“Just skip the word, but keep going,” I prompted as I sat\n",
      "back down.\n",
      "“If he had said it was okay to…do it, you wouldn’t be\n",
      "asking me to do it every day?”\n",
      "“Well, I imagine I’d still want you, but I’m not sure I’d\n",
      "say it out loud, and deﬁnitely not this much. Two months\n",
      "after the surgery…well, since then I’m extremely…\n",
      "whatever .” Feeling my face ﬂush, I pressed the back of my\n",
      "hand to my cheek.\n",
      "“What’s wrong?”\n",
      "“Nothing, just a little hot in here.”\n",
      "“Finish your sentence.”\n",
      "We locked eyes and I managed to hold his intense gaze\n",
      "for a whopping ten seconds.\n",
      "“Horny ,” I said, my voice frustrated and maybe a little\n",
      "louder than I was anticipa ting. “Horny ,” I repeated, more to\n",
      "myself this time.\n",
      "The hostess, the girl who had walked us to our table,\n",
      "came back. “Hi. W elcome again. What can I get you folks?” Jack and I were still staring at each other , and I didn’t\n",
      "want to be the ﬁrst one to break eye contact. It was him\n",
      "doing stuﬀ like this that was making me fall for him more\n",
      "and more. His intense gaze managed to touch all sorts of\n",
      "places, and when he was looking at me like that, I lost my\n",
      "mind a little.\n",
      "“Hi,” I said brightly , and Jack ﬁnally moved his gaze to\n",
      "the girl. I sighed in relief and slumped in my seat. I’d just\n",
      "told him I was horny . Nice choice of word, for sure.\n",
      "“You want to share a pizza or are you going with pasta?”\n",
      "I quickly returned back to the world. “Pizza.”\n",
      "“What do you want on—”\n",
      "“Mushrooms,” I blurted out. “And maybe artichokes\n",
      "too.”\n",
      "“That’s it?”\n",
      "“No, you add something too . What do you want?”\n",
      "“Pepperoni. Y ou’ll have water?”\n",
      "I nodded and let him ﬁnish our order then, just as the\n",
      "girl left after promising to get our drinks ASAP , my gaze\n",
      "caught on an empty booth toward the back.\n",
      "“Did you hear anything from your cousins?”\n",
      "When I gave him a confused look, he continued.\n",
      "“About your surgery . Did they call you to check on you?”\n",
      "“No. I’m not even sure if I want to hear from them. I’m\n",
      "surprised that Bryan never showed up again though. Did he\n",
      "call you? I feel like he gave up too easily .”\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "Because I wanted tonight  to be just about us, I changed\n",
      "the subject and didn’t think too much about his angry\n",
      "expression.\n",
      "Pointing with my ﬁnger  at the booth in the back, I\n",
      "waited for him to follow my direction.\n",
      "“Yes…that’s a table, I believe.”\n",
      "“Ha ha.” Giving him a pointedly blank look, I ignored his\n",
      "dry comment. “Can we sit there?”\n",
      "“You don’t like it here?” “No. No, I do, but a booth…I don’t know , it feels more\n",
      "intimate.”\n",
      "Jack caught the attention  of the girl as she was bringing\n",
      "a soda to the cute little kid next to us and then helped me\n",
      "out of my seat and carried my coat. The touch of his hand\n",
      "on the small of my back practically seared me through my\n",
      "dress. I got in ﬁrst and scooted.\n",
      "Instead of sitting next to me as I had assumed he would\n",
      "and wanted him to do, he went to sit across from me again.\n",
      "“What are you doing?” I asked, perplexed.\n",
      "“What does it look like I’m doing?”\n",
      "“Jack, you’re gonna sit here.” I patted the seat next to\n",
      "me. “That’s why I wanted a booth.”\n",
      "“To sit next to me,” he echoed.\n",
      "I nodded slowly .\n",
      "“We could’ve moved our chairs closer to each other .”\n",
      "“It’s not the same thing. Come on. Move.”\n",
      "“No touching, Rose. I’m serious. Do not drive me crazy\n",
      "in public.”\n",
      "Hearing that I had any kind of power over him was\n",
      "exhilarating. Happy and excited, I laughed and raised my\n",
      "hands. “No touching—got it. Come on, I won’t bite. I\n",
      "promise.”\n",
      "And what do you know…as soon as he settled next to\n",
      "me, he reached for my hand and tightly clasped it in his,\n",
      "playing with my ring the entire time. He was the one who\n",
      "couldn’t stop touching me, and I loved every second of it.\n",
      "We talked for hours in that little Italian restaurant,\n",
      "accompanied by some romantic Italian tunes. If Jack wasn’t\n",
      "touching my face, he was holding my hand. If he wasn’t\n",
      "holding my hand, he was oﬀering me bites of pizza as I\n",
      "chattered away at him. When he wasn’t making me laugh\n",
      "with his dry comments, he was resting our linked hands on\n",
      "his leg. When I wasn’t smiling or laughing, I was melting.\n",
      "He also kissed me. I didn’t know why I was surprised,\n",
      "but he kissed me so many times. Every time he leaned forward and I felt his lips moving against mine, asking for\n",
      "entrance, my heart lost its steady rhythm and I felt\n",
      "excitement bubbling up inside me, the kind of excitement\n",
      "you don’t know how to hold in, an excess of happiness. I\n",
      "loved it. I completely fell for him on our ﬁrst date.\n",
      "It was the most perfect ﬁrst date I’d ever had in my life.\n",
      "My husband was perfect. With all his arrogance and\n",
      "prickliness, Jack Hawthorne was perfect for me.\n",
      "He wasn’t what I’d had in mind or even what I’d wanted\n",
      "for myself , but he was perfect and already mine, truly mine.\n",
      "There was no doubt of that in my mind. ICHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR\n",
      "ROSE\n",
      "t was after the oﬀicial ﬁrst date, not days after, only\n",
      "hours when I woke up with a weird feeling.\n",
      "It was so hard to sleep in the same bed with Jack after\n",
      "I’d started feeling better  from the surgery . As much as I\n",
      "talked about wanting to get him into bed naked, I never\n",
      "actually did anything about it, at least not when we were in\n",
      "bed like this.\n",
      "That being said, I wasn’t actually surprised to ﬁnd Jack\n",
      "spooning me—that happened a lot. I woke up in a lot of\n",
      "diﬀerent positions in the morning, usually with my face\n",
      "tucked under his chin, my hand across his chest.\n",
      "Sometimes my face was on his chest with his arms wrapped\n",
      "around me, and there had been a few instances where we\n",
      "had woken up fused to each other just like we were right\n",
      "then.\n",
      "Little spoon, meet big spoon.\n",
      "In the hospital, that had been the only position we had\n",
      "slept in, but that was only because the bed wasn’t big\n",
      "enough for any other positioning. At the hospital , sex had\n",
      "been the last thing on my mind, but out of it…the  last two\n",
      "months, things had been diﬀerent. In those instances\n",
      "where we had woken up with his front pressed to my back,\n",
      "he usually got out of bed as quickly as possible and I said a silent goodbye to his lovely erection that had been pressing\n",
      "into me from behind.\n",
      "Those mornings were my favorite, because it was\n",
      "something else to wake up wrapped in his arms. I felt\n",
      "protected, cared for, and maybe for the ﬁrst time in a very\n",
      "long time, like I belonged somewhere: in his arms. Those\n",
      "times, I wasn’t brave enough to tease him, and I just closed\n",
      "my eyes and took my ﬁll instead.\n",
      "When we were both vertical and wearing actual clothes,\n",
      "that was when I ﬂourished in making him squirm. So much\n",
      "for my bravery .\n",
      "“Jack?” I mumbled, peering over my shoulder . His lips\n",
      "were right there, only inches away , and I shivered when\n",
      "those same full lips pressed a kiss on my bare shoulder . He\n",
      "was already awake, appa rently . I tried to turn onto my back\n",
      "so I could look at him, but with his body covering mine, it\n",
      "wasn’t possible. I only managed to turn halfway , craning my\n",
      "neck back the rest of the way. “Is everything okay?” I\n",
      "croaked out, my voice heavy with sleep. Apart from the city\n",
      "lights casting a shadow on his face, there were no lights on,\n",
      "just us.\n",
      "“Go back to sleep,” he whispered.\n",
      "Jack’s hand found mine and I held it up, palm against\n",
      "palm, his skin warm against my ﬁngertips.\n",
      "“What’s wrong?” I asked.\n",
      "“Nothing.”\n",
      "Watching our hands dance as he gently tapped his\n",
      "ﬁngers against mine in the low light, I linked my ﬁngers\n",
      "with his, tightly , and listened to him release a long breath.\n",
      "“You want me to believe you just woke up to hold hands\n",
      "with me?”\n",
      "“I talked to your doctor today .”\n",
      "I turned my body a little more toward him and\n",
      "cautiously watched his face.\n",
      "“When?”\n",
      "“After dinner . I called his private phone.” “And?” I prompted anxiou sly when he didn’t go on. I was\n",
      "starting to hate the word doctor .\n",
      "“He sent the email today with the results, and I thought\n",
      "it was a bill so I opened it. The MRI was clean. The surgery\n",
      "worked. There is no tear in your membrane anymore.”\n",
      "I closed my eyes and dropped my head back onto the\n",
      "pillow , releas ing the biggest sigh in the world. I was feeling\n",
      "a little dizzy with relief . A weight had been lifted oﬀ my\n",
      "chest with his words, the equivalent of a baby elephant. I\n",
      "felt worlds lighter .\n",
      "“But you still need to be careful—you know that, right?”\n",
      "Jack reminded me.\n",
      "That I did. The doctor had warned me that usually when\n",
      "a CSF leak happens out of nowhere, there is a high chance\n",
      "that the same issue can pop up in a diﬀerent part of the\n",
      "membrane. If the pressure is constantly high, it really is\n",
      "inevitable.\n",
      "I opened my eyes and looked at Jack with a big smile. “I\n",
      "know , I know , but I’m still happy to have good news.”\n",
      "However , Jack didn’t look all that happy . My brows lowered.\n",
      "“Is everything else okay? You don’t look very excited.” I\n",
      "touched the space between his brows with my ﬁngertip\n",
      "after I pulled my hand out of his grip. “ Why this frown?”\n",
      "Catching my ﬁnger in his hand, he leaned down and\n",
      "pressed a soft kiss on my temple that caused my eyes to fall\n",
      "closed and my entire body to wake up and take notice of\n",
      "the man looking at me with such an intense expression on\n",
      "his face.\n",
      "“Jack,” I mumbled. My brain was screaming Danger! —\n",
      "the good kind.\n",
      "“I asked if we were cleared for sex.”\n",
      "That shut me up. My heart rate slowly picked up, and\n",
      "suddenly the room felt hotter .\n",
      "“And?”\n",
      "I swallowed and held my breath. His victorious ﬁngers found a way to link mine with his\n",
      "again, and he gave them  a squeeze as he stared  into my\n",
      "eyes. “He said if we took it slow , it’d be ﬁne.”\n",
      "“Huh.”\n",
      "That was all I could come up with to say. Huh.  I was a\n",
      "genius for sure.\n",
      "I gave  him my back but kept my tight hold on his hand\n",
      "so he was forced to spoon me again.\n",
      "“Why didn’t you tell me before?”\n",
      "“I thought we should wait the last ﬁve days.”\n",
      "“Now? Now you don’t think we should.”\n",
      "“No, I don’t think we should.”\n",
      "“What are you thinking?”  he whispered into my ear in a\n",
      "hoarse voice, causing all the hairs on my arms to rise. “I\n",
      "thought you were waitin g for this. I thought you wanted\n",
      "this.”\n",
      "I worr ied my teeth over my bottom lip. I could hear\n",
      "every little noise in the room. His breathing was low and\n",
      "deep, and the sound the sheets made when he tucked his\n",
      "legs behind mine was a soft swoosh, caressing my senses.\n",
      "I was on the edge of whimpering like a little girl when I\n",
      "felt his tongue on my neck, kissing me, tasting me.\n",
      "“I do want to,” I whispered, my eyes ﬂuttering closed as\n",
      "if I was afraid he’d hear me.\n",
      "Silence followed my words for at least a full minute.\n",
      "“It’s okay , Rose. Go back to sleep,” he whispered back.\n",
      "How could I when his hard-on was getting harder and\n",
      "harder to ignore? I squeezed my eyes shut and went for it.\n",
      "“I didn’t think you’d ask me.”\n",
      "“Ask you what?”\n",
      "Groaning, I turned my head and burrowed it into the\n",
      "pillow , trying to be careful with my nose. “It sounds weird\n",
      "when I say it out loud.”\n",
      "“How would you know that if you don’t say it? Come on,\n",
      "let’s hear it.” Releasing my breath, I opened my eyes and looked out\n",
      "the windows in the terrace doors. “I thought when it\n",
      "happened, it’d just…happen.”\n",
      "His hand let go of mine and he started stroking my waist\n",
      "and then my arm. “ What do you mean exactly?”\n",
      "How could I think of anything when he was touching\n",
      "me?\n",
      "“I’m not sure if you’ve noticed that I talk a big talk, Jack,\n",
      "but I’m not exactly an expert when it comes to getting busy.\n",
      "I’m not saying I’m bad or anything, I’m just saying I’m\n",

      "with three and a half people—”\n",
      "“Half? No, I take it back. I don’t want to know . I already\n",
      "want to kill all three and a half of them.”\n",
      "“Cute. You know I’m a romantic, so I thought when the\n",
      "time came, you’d just wake me up in the middle of the night\n",
      "and take me, you know , because you couldn’t wait any\n",
      "longer…or we’d walk into the apartment and you’d just lift\n",
      "me up and I would wrap my legs around you and you’d say\n",
      "fuck it and we’d go for it, or you could push me against a\n",
      "wall and do it like that. I didn’t think you’d  ask my\n",
      "permission to have sex with me. It’s making me feel\n",
      "nervous.”\n",
      "“Sounds like you’ve been thinking about the logistics of\n",

      "ﬁngers pressed into my skin, holding me at my waist. “Are\n",
      "you making fun of me?”\n",
      "I caug ht his smile right before he captured my lips in a\n",
      "deep kiss and my eyes closed on their own. I slowly slipped\n",
      "my tongue in, brushing it against his as I turned  onto my back so I could kiss him deeper . This time he let me, and\n",

      "my shirt and, with no hesitation whatsoever , he pushed his\n",
      "hand right down into my underwear , going straight for my\n",
      "core.\n",
      "I moaned into his mouth and let my thighs fall open. He\n",
      "growled right back and pushed one ﬁnger inside me then\n",
      "he slowly added another . My body oﬀered no resistance,\n",
      "already wet for him. I made a low sound in the back of my\n",
      "throat when he pushed his ﬁngers as deep as they would\n",
      "go, moving excruciatingly slowly .\n",
      "I just kept kissing him through it, holding his face to me\n",
      "with both of my hands, hungrier by the second. I was so\n",
      "ready for this, for us to be a real thing, and this was sealing\n",
      "the deal. We had done everything backward—I’d even\n",
      "fallen for him before having an oﬀicial ﬁrst date—but this…\n",
      "this would make everything right.\n",
      "When I was sure he wasn’t ending the kiss before I\n",
      "wanted him to, my hands managed to ﬁnd their way down\n",
      "into his pants, and the kiss turned into somethi ng much\n",
      "diﬀerent once I had my hand wrapped around the base of\n",
      "his cock.\n",
      "Still kissing him uncontrollably , I took a deep breath\n",
      "through my nose and whimpered into his mouth when he\n",
      "started ﬁngering me in earnest, his thumb ﬁrmly pressing\n",
      "on my clit. I moved my hips as much as I could, his hand\n",
      "driving me out of my mind.\n",
      "My body burning and tingling at the same time, I tore\n",
      "my mouth away from his and bit on my lip to hold in an\n",
      "embarrassingly long and loud moan. My hand tightened\n",
      "around his cock. I could hear all the noises him ﬁngering\n",
      "me was making, and it was only getting me more worked\n",
      "up.\n",
      "“You’re dripping all over my hand again,” he murmured,\n",
      "and I was happy to see that he was just as out of breath as I\n",
      "was. He nipped my jawline, my neck, my earlobe. All I could manage in return was to hold on to his cock,\n",
      "giving it a very rough pull every now and then when I could\n",
      "remember to do so .\n",
      "My entire focus was on his ﬁngers and then his lips were\n",
      "trailing along my neck, biting softly and lickin g. I was\n",
      "seconds away from comin g on his hand. I worked my hips,\n",
      "pushing them  down to take more of his ﬁngers even though\n",
      "he was giving me everything. I wanted more, deeper ,\n",
      "harder .\n",
      "I only realized I was saying my thoughts out loud when\n",
      "he said, “Okay . Whateve r you want, Rose, I’ll give it to\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "When he pulled his ﬁngers out of me, I sobered up a\n",
      "little.\n",
      "“But…”\n",
      "“Shhh.”\n",
      "I close d my legs, trying to ﬁnd some kind of relief , and\n",
      "started pulling on his thick cock a little faster now that I\n",
      "could use my brain again , but he put a stop to that pretty\n",
      "quickly by sitting upright and gently pulling my hand out of\n",
      "his pants.\n",
      "When I tried to sit up too, he softly pressed a hand on\n",
      "my shoulder and kept me in place. “Stay still for a second.”\n",
      "I huﬀed but stopped squirming when he went for my\n",
      "underwear and pulled them oﬀ .\n",
      "“Shit.” When his ﬁngers parted me and I felt the cool air\n",
      "between my legs, I was already panting. My entire focus\n",
      "was on Jack and what he would do next. He put his big\n",
      "hands on my inner thighs and opened me wider for his\n",
      "perusal.\n",
      "Two possess ive ﬁngers entered me again, and then\n",
      "those two quickly turned into three scissoring inside of me.\n",
      "For the life of me, I couldn’t keep still, and the more he\n",
      "didn’t take his eyes away from where his ﬁngers were\n",
      "disappearing into, the hotter and brighter the ﬁre inside of me burned. He leaned down and started licking my clit and\n",
      "all around it with a ﬁrm tongue.\n",
      "“Jack,” I mewled embarrassingly .\n",
      "“Right,” he mumbled, and after one ﬁnal delicious lick,\n",
      "he stopped again.\n",
      "I groan ed and tried to close my legs with his ﬁngers still\n",
      "inside. I was pretty sure that would help me get some\n",
      "relief .\n",
      "His palm pressed into the sensitive skin on the inside of\n",
      "my thigh. “No, keep them open.”\n",
      "“I want to see you too,” I admitted. “I don’t feel\n",
      "particularly patient at the moment.”\n",
      "“Neither do I,” he agreed, his eyes devouring me. The\n",
      "next thing I knew , his ﬁngers left me and he was taking oﬀ\n",
      "his shirt. I was still trying  to get over his pecs and abs that\n",
      "were just out of my reach. He had insisted on being fully\n",
      "clothed at all times when he was in bed with me. I had\n",
      "disagreed wholeheartedly , but he had won. He got oﬀ the\n",
      "bed. I sat up straight and got up on my knees in the middle\n",
      "of the sheets.\n",
      "“Jack,” I started, but I didn’t get far as he got rid of his\n",
      "pajama pants next. I couldn’t take my eyes away as his\n",
      "thick, veiny cock bobbed  in the air, almost reaching his\n",
      "navel.\n",
      "Oh, this was really happening, and I was all for it.\n",
      "Holding his eyes with my own, I reached for the bottom\n",
      "of my shirt and took it oﬀ. Clothes were overrated anyway .\n",
      "Then I reached behind my back and took oﬀ my bra,\n",
      "throwing them both on the ﬂoor. A second later, Jack\n",
      "released a long groan and he was back in the bed with me,\n",
      "slamming into me and going straight for my mouth.\n",
      "Compared to the kiss he gave me then, all the kisses we\n",
      "had shared so far would be considered innocent. I tilted my\n",
      "head to the side and let him go in deeper . One of his hands\n",
      "cupped the back of my head, the other gripping my waist in\n",
      "an almost bruising hold. I didn’t care. All that mattered was that he was holding me to himself so he could take as much\n",
      "as he wanted. His cock was pressed between us, the wet\n",
      "and swollen head brushing my stomach. His other hand\n",
      "released its hold on my waist and trailed up, the drag of his\n",
      "skin on mine tipping me even further into delirium as he\n",
      "found my breast and mold ed it into his hand, squee zing and\n",
      "pulling on my nipple until I was moaning and making all\n",
      "kinds of noises.\n",
      "The second his lips gave mine a break, he went for my\n",
      "ears, licking  and nipping his way down my throat to my\n",
      "boobs. I arched my back, oﬀering myself to him. He latched\n",
      "onto my nipple with his mouth and started sucking with\n",
      "deep, sensual pulls as his other hand moved to caress and\n",
      "knead the other , getting it ready for the same treatment. I\n",
      "let my head drop back and tangled my ﬁngers through his\n",
      "hair, gripping tight.\n",
      "My heart felt like it was beating in my throat, my pulse\n",
      "all over the place. There was one thing I was sure of: I\n",
      "would never forget Jack Hawthorne and his touch in this\n",
      "lifetime.\n",
      "When he sucked my nipple into his mouth deeper and\n",
      "harder than I was expecting him to, I had to steady myself\n",
      "with one hand curling around the hard muscle of his\n",
      "shoulder as I tried my very best to catch my breath. I’d\n",
      "never in my life come from just that, but I was surprisingly\n",
      "close.\n",
      "“Jack,” I murmured on an exhalation as he hummed and\n",
      "sucked my nipples, sending electricity all over my body. I\n",
      "wasn’t sure how I was even staying up on my knees. “Jack,”\n",
      "I repeated. “I want you. I can’t wait. I don’t want to wait.”\n",
      "When he lifted his head to look into my eyes, I was still\n",
      "moaning, my body twitching. I hadn’t come, but I was\n",
      "pretty damn close to it.\n",
      "“Hmmm,” he murmured, kissing me again, tangli ng his\n",
      "tongue with mine. Even though I was naked, I felt warm all over, tingly . “Are you sure it’s not just talk? You really want\n",
      "me to fuck you?”\n",
      "I reached between us and gave him a few luxuriating\n",
      "pulls that, as far as I could tell, he enjoyed since he nipped\n",
      "my bottom lip. I used my thumb to spread the warm liquid\n",
      "around the head and before I could do anything else, he\n",
      "tore himself away and went for the bedside table. I watched\n",
      "in awe as he ripped open a condom packet and slowly\n",
      "rolled it onto himself . I’d put them there myself to give him\n",
      "a hint. The second it was done, he was by my side. He\n",
      "turned my body until I was facing the headboar d and he\n",
      "was on his knees right behind me.\n",
      "“Open your legs as wide  as you can for me, baby,” he\n",
      "muttered, his lips licking  and biting my neck. Every kiss\n",
      "caused a full body shiver , and I was sure I would die happy\n",
      "after this. “Hold on to the headboard if you need to .”\n",
      "I was turned on like I had never been turned on before. I\n",
      "would do whatever he wanted me to. I moved on my knees\n",
      "and opened my legs wide r, balancing myself with one hand\n",
      "on the headboard. When  he put both of his hands on the\n",
      "insides of my thighs and spread me even wider, his\n",
      "ﬁngertips grazing my wetness, I thought I experienced a\n",
      "very tiny orgasm.\n",
      "My throat was already hoarse when he ﬁnally settled\n",
      "himself betw een my wide open legs, his knees resting right\n",
      "beside mine, keeping me open. “Lay your head back,” he\n",
      "whispered into my ear, causing another shiver to go\n",
      "through my body .\n",
      "“Jack,” I moaned. It seemed like I couldn’t come up with\n",
      "any other word.\n",
      "“I need you so badly ,” he whispered, his lips moving\n",
      "against my skin as he spoke, his hot breath keeping me on\n",
      "edge. I’d take it—I’d take him needing me any day .\n",
      "I felt his left palm covering my stomach and then his\n",
      "right hand guiding his cock between my legs, moving it up\n",
      "and down my slit, spreading my wetness all over his shaft. “Jack,” I repeated again.\n",
      "“Hmmm.”\n",
      "“Please…enough.”\n",
      "“You want me.”\n",
      "“I do .”\n",
      "“Tell me. Say the words.”\n",
      "“I want you like crazy , Jack.”\n",
      "“Just me, Rose. I’m the only one.”\n",
      "I closed my eyes. He wanted me to die a slow death\n",
      "then. “I’ve never wanted anyone as much as I want you.”\n",
      "That seemed to satisfy him.\n",
      "“Kiss me then. Give me your mouth before I take you,”\n",
      "he said.\n",
      "The back of my head was already resting against his\n",
      "shoulder so I turned it to the left, and his mouth took mine\n",
      "in a rough kiss. The next thing I knew , before I could take\n",
      "in my next breath, he was pushing inside me in a slow and\n",
      "never-ending slide. I ripped my lips away from his and\n",
      "released a long, long moan, my head pushing back, my eyes\n",
      "closed shut.\n",
      "“Okay?” he asked, and all I could do was bite my lip and\n",
      "nod. “You feel so good,” he murmured, pushing the rest of\n",
      "his cock in. He was stretching me wide open and I was\n",
      "loving it. My muscles quivering, my moan started up again.\n",
      "I could already see color s dancing in front of my eyes.\n",
      "“That’s so good, Jack.”\n",
      "“Yeah?”\n",
      "His left palm  pushed harder on my stomach, pulling me\n",
      "against him, and ﬁnally I took all of it. I tried to open my\n",
      "legs wider to get more comfortable because my right thigh\n",
      "had started shaking, but the little bit of pain that came with\n",
      "his size and our position made everything feel a hundred\n",
      "times better .\n",
      "He started pulling out and I gripped his forearm to hold\n",
      "on to him. One of my hands was still grasping the headboard, but I needed to feel his skin against my\n",
      "ﬁngertips. “Easy ,” I groaned.\n",
      "“You want me to stop? So soon?”\n",
      "“I’ll kill you if you stop,” I gasped out.\n",
      "“Then what? It hurts?” he asked, his nose nuzzling my\n",
      "neck.\n",
      "“Good hurt,” I managed to get out.\n",
      "“Good.”\n",
      "Slowly he pulled out only halfway and then pushed in\n",
      "again. This time, I took him in more easily . I’d never had\n",
      "sex this slowly , had never known it could feel that good and\n",
      "also deliciously painful in a way .\n",
      "“Is that good for you too?” I asked, feeling bold.\n",
      "“You have no idea,” he groaned, starting steady thrusts\n",
      "as I got comfortable with his size. I was soaking him in my\n",
      "wetness. “I could fuck you like this for hours.”\n",
      "Feeling overwhelmed, I chuckled, but then he thrust up\n",
      "all the way in and it turned into another moan. “I think I’d\n",
      "die from pleasure.”\n",
      "“I would never let you die, just trying to fuck you good.”\n",
      "“I’d love to die like this.”\n",
      "He started a slow rhythm that had me moaning\n",
      "constantly . Every time my head dropped forward, he\n",
      "warned me to keep it tilted back against him, and his worry\n",
      "for me helped build my pleasure higher and higher .\n",
      "“Was this what you imagined all those times you teased\n",
      "me?”\n",
      "“Better ,” I whispered, and his ﬁngers dug deeper into\n",
      "my stomach. My breat h and heart out of control, I\n",
      "tightened my grip on his forearm. We’d both leave our\n",
      "mark on each other by the time we were done, and I\n",
      "wouldn’t want to have it any other way .\n",
      "“Jack,” I gasped, a little panic trickling into my voice\n",
      "only a few short minutes after he had started fucking me.\n",
      "“What? We’re stopping again?” he asked, not slowing\n",
      "down his thrusts. I held the wrist of his left hand, which was still pressing on my stomach.\n",
      "“No, no, no,” I chanted, and his thrusts started to go\n",
      "deeper and faster . I back ed my hips up, trying to somehow\n",
      "take him even deeper . His right hand wrapped around me\n",
      "too, grasping my hip as my butt bounced oﬀ the tops of his\n",
      "thighs. “ Jack…Jack, I’m gonna come. Don’t stop.”\n",
      "“Come on, Rose. Come all over my cock, baby. Let me\n",
      "feel how much you want me.” He bit on my earlobe and I\n",
      "lost it. “ Yes, baby . Just like that. Ride it. T ake my cock.”\n",
      "I closed my eyes, and listening to his rough voice push\n",
      "me right over the edge and into oblivion. Gasping his name,\n",
      "I felt heat burst between my legs, and all the muscles in my\n",
      "body tightened. I let go of the headboard and threw my\n",
      "right hand back, gripping Jack’s hair, pulling involuntarily . I\n",
      "moaned long and hard as my body shivered in his arms and\n",
      "he kept riding me hard through my orgasm, his lips tracing\n",
      "an invisible line on my neck.\n",
      "When my body started relaxing around him, he slowed\n",
      "down.\n",
      "“Was that good enough?”\n",
      "I could do nothing but nod. I had been too loud and had\n",
      "come too hard. Anywhere  he was in contact with my body\n",
      "was burning, but I felt the heat in my cheeks even more.\n",
      "“Do you feel how slick you are for me? How hard you\n",
      "came on my cock?”\n",
      "It was impossible not to feel it. My only answer was\n",
      "another nod. He went deeper into me as I whimp ered. His\n",
      "right hand cupped the heavy weight of my breast, and I\n",
      "shamelessly arched into it.\n",
      "Lust licked at my skin. When he quickened his pace just\n",
      "a fraction, I sucked in a breath of air . “Shit.”\n",
      "“You’ll come again.”\n",
      "“Always givin g orders,” I murmured, all my focus on the\n",
      "spot where we became one.\n",
      "“It wasn’t an order , Rose, just pointing out the obvious.” He buried his face in my neck and pinched my nipple,\n",
      "his thrusts uncompromising. I released something between\n",
      "a gasp and a groan.\n",
      "God, the strength of him holding me—it was just as\n",
      "powerful as his thrusts. I loosened my hold on his wrist and\n",
      "splayed my hand on top of his, silently telling him I wanted\n",
      "more pressure.\n",
      "“I’ll bruise you,” he whispered.\n",
      "“I want you to,” I whispered back, turning my head and\n",
      "pressing my forehead against his hot throat.\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "“I want everything from you, Jack, everything and more.\n",
      "I want  you to leave a mark on me.” It was nothing more\n",
      "than a breathy statemen t that had a double meaning as I\n",
      "realized I was seconds away from another orgasm.\n",
      "“Open your mouth,” he ordered, moving his head back.\n",
      "I lifted my head and let him invade my mouth in a\n",
      "blazing kiss at the same moment his thrusts became\n",
      "exquisitely demanding. The taste of him, of his hunger\n",
      "rushed over me as I started coming again. He moved his\n",
      "right hand down my body, and the feel of his skin against\n",
      "my sensitive areas cause d me to tremble in his arms as he\n",
      "jackhammered into me. He did nothing but cover my pussy\n",
      "with his hand, the heel of it pressing hard on my clit.\n",
      "Through the fog that had ﬁlled my brain, I felt him go\n",
      "impossibly deeper as I whimpered into his mouth, my body\n",
      "shaking in the aftermath. The little grunts of pleasure\n",
      "escaping from  him made my toes curl. He thrust deeply two\n",
      "more times then stilled inside me. I groaned softly as my\n",
      "inner muscle s quivered around his length. I was lost in his\n",
      "hunger , his hunger for me.\n",
      "He gave me a few more lazy, luxuriating thrusts that\n",
      "caressed me from the inside as both his hands rested on\n",
      "top of my thighs. I had a feeling he didn’t want to let go,\n",
      "which was just ﬁne with me. I never wanted him to let go of\n",
      "me either . “Is this real? ” I asked, out of breath as he started to pull\n",
      "out.\n",
      "He stilled behind me. “ What do you mean?”\n",
      "“I’m not dreaming this, am I?” I moved my hands up and\n",
      "down his forearms, my head still resting on his broad\n",
      "shoulder . Rolling my head, I looked up at him through\n",
      "dazed and probably half -lost eyes.\n",
      "He smiled the sweetest, sexiest smile and kissed my lips.\n",
      "“This—we—are as real as it gets.” His hands moved and he\n",
      "wrapped them around me in a tight grip, his forearms\n",
      "holding up the weight of my breasts. After a long squeeze,\n",
      "which I loved, he whispered into my ear. “I need to get rid\n",
      "of the condom, baby . Let go of me.”\n",
      "I dropped my hands and held back a small whimper\n",
      "when he pulled out. However , I couldn’t stop the trembling\n",
      "in my body when his palm moved on the curve of my ass.\n",
      "“Lie down—you’re shaking.”\n",
      "I did so happily .\n",
      "When he came back, I was hiding under the covers, my\n",
      "head resting on the pillow , my hands tucked under my\n",
      "cheek. I tracked his every move and secretly high-ﬁved\n",
      "myself when I noticed he was still naked. His cock was\n",
      "impressive even when it wasn’t doing things to me.\n",
      "He lay down, facing me.\n",
      "“Hi,” I whispered.\n",
      "He took a deep breath and then released it. “Hello,\n",
      "Rose.” His lips met mine and I smiled through our short-\n",
      "lived kiss. “What’s the smile for?” he asked, his lips moving\n",
      "against mine as our noses bumped.\n",
      "“I’d share my door with you any day , Jack Hawthorne.”\n",
      "His brows dipped together . “What are you talking\n",
      "about?”\n",
      "“If you’ve never seen Titanic , I can’t be married to you,”\n",
      "I said seriously .\n",
      "Unfortunately , the confusion didn’t clear from his eyes,\n",
      "but a smile did touch his lips. “I think it’s a little late for that.”\n",
      "“You haven’t seen it. Jack and Rose…the Titanic…”\n",
      "“I know the movie, but I don’t think I’ve seen it.”\n",
      "“If I was conﬁdent I could walk out of this room, I’d\n",
      "force you to watch it right now, but since that’s not\n",
      "happening, clear your schedule—we’re watching it\n",
      "tomorrow .”\n",
      "His hand brushed my hair away from my face. “Okay .\n",
      "How are you feeling?”\n",
      "Now I let my own lips curve up. “For a minute there, my\n",
      "brain tingled.”\n",

      "She nodded and walked ahead of me as I followed.\n",
      "Finally we made it to my oﬀice, and instead of taking a\n",

      "of the room. Before I could turn around and close the door\n",
      "for some sense of privacy , Cynthia appeared in the\n",

      "and just picked a damn book that was within reach then, as\n",
      "calmly as I could manage, walked back into the kitchen. As\n",
      "soon as I was out of his sight, I leaned back against the wall\n",
      "and wiped at my tears.\n",
      "I was still very much pissed oﬀ and hurt. It was a tossup\n",
      "between the two of us as to who I was angrier with—him or\n",
      "myself . My heart was broken, replaced with a constant\n",
      "ache. I was such a damn fool for thinking he had been\n",
      "honest with me every step of the way. I’d thought he was\n",
      "too serious not to be. My words, my last words to him\n",
      "echoed back in my head, along with the surprised and hurt\n",
      "look on his face when I’d spoken them. I knew I’d screwed\n",
      "it up at the end there, but I had wanted to hurt him. I’d\n",
      "wanted him to hurt just like I was because misery always\n",
      "loves company .\n",
      "I chanced another peek and saw he was still stand ing in\n",
      "the same spot. He hadn’ t moved an inch. It shou ld’ve felt\n",
      "stalkerish, him standing outside, wearing a black coat as he leaned again st the lamp pole, but it didn’t. It hurt my heart\n",
      "even more to see him standing there alone in the snow .\n",
      "He wasn’t happy .\n",
      "I wasn’t happy .\n",
      "I wished we could’ve been unhappy together , under the\n",
      "same roof, but I couldn’t do it. I couldn’t look at his face\n",
      "and ignore that he had lied to me so monumentall y. What if\n",
      "I had hated him, hated everything about him?\n",
      "Marriage for one, please! Coming right up!\n",
      "But then…\n",
      "But then…that’s when things started to get tricky . As\n",
      "much as I hated to admit it, if he wasn’t lying now and what\n",
      "he had said about Joshu a was true, it looked like he had\n",
      "saved me from him. He had given me my dream, and on a\n",
      "silver platter . Not a coﬀee shop, but a family . Someone I\n",
      "could lean on. He had done all of that just for the chance of\n",
      "a shot with me, for me. He was in love with me, and that\n",
      "knowledge threatened to pull the rug out from beneath my\n",
      "feet.\n",
      "He was in love with me.\n",
      "Then again, I already knew that. I’d seen it in his\n",
      "beautiful blue eyes, day after day. I knew the exact\n",
      "moment, that ﬁrst time I’d seen it, seen the possibility of\n",
      "us: in that dark hospital room when he had crawl ed in bed\n",
      "with me. That was the ﬁrst night I’d thought, You know\n",
      "what, Rose, maybe he actually likes you. Despi te all his\n",
      "prickliness and, at times, arrogance, despite all the\n",
      "scowling looks, maybe he really cares about you.\n",
      "Feeling dizzy , I slid down the wall and let my head rest\n",
      "against it. I didn’t know  how many minutes passed, but\n",
      "when I felt okay enough to move again, I glanced around\n",
      "the corner , making sure I wasn’t visible to him just in case\n",
      "he was still standing there.\n",
      "He was.\n",
      "We had ended as we begun. I watc hed him from the safety of the kitchen’s doorway ,\n",
      "the book I’d picked forgo tten on the ﬂoor beside me. I must\n",
      "have fallen asleep somet ime after four AM and jumped up\n",
      "in a panic when Owen walked through the door with a\n",
      "confused look on his face.\n",
      "“What the hell are you doing on the ﬂoor?”\n",
      "My mouth was dry, my eyes burning, and my voice came\n",
      "out all scratchy when I tried to speak. “Good morning to\n",
      "you too, sunshine. Just getting some shut-eye, as you can\n",
      "see.”\n",
      "“Right, beca use that’s what you do on the ﬂoor. What\n",
      "was Jack doing outside?”\n",
      "After a few attempts at getting up, I gave up and got on\n",
      "my knees so I could hold on to the edge of the island and\n",
      "pull myself up. “ What are you talking about?”\n",
      "Owen oﬀered me his hand and helped me.\n",
      "“He was right outside, half frozen from the looks of him.\n",
      "He said good morning and then left. Is this your version of\n",
      "spicing up your marriage , or did you guys have a ﬁght or\n",
      "something?”\n",
      "I push ed my hair away from my face. “Or something,” I\n",
      "mumbled.\n",
      "As Owen walked past me, shaking his head, I carefully\n",
      "looked out from the doorway, my eyes searching  for him.\n",
      "When I couldn’t ﬁnd what I was looking for, I fully stepped\n",
      "out of the kitchen and walked through the tables until I was\n",
      "standing right in front of the window , looking outside.\n",
      "Just like Owen had said, he was gone.\n",
      "THE NEXT  NIGHT , I stayed at Sally’s place, swapping the\n",
      "comfort of the coﬀee shop’s kitchen island and the lined-up\n",
      "chairs for a couch. I spent hours with my phone in my hand\n",
      "as I debated texting him. Eventually I fell asleep with my phone on my chest and never messaged him. I thought I\n",
      "slept for about three hours in total, and he kept me\n",
      "company in my dreams the rest of the time, which was even\n",
      "worse than not getting any sleep because when I woke up, I\n",
      "lost him all over again.\n",
      "Sally had seen the two suitcases I owned stacked in the\n",
      "little oﬀice room in the back and had already guessed that\n",
      "something was seriously wrong. Since I thought I’d lose my\n",
      "ever-loving mind if I didn’t tell at least one person what\n",
      "was going on, I told her everything. I rushed through\n",
      "admitting our whole marriage was nothing but a business\n",
      "deal and that we’d been wrong to assume otherw ise. Then\n",
      "I’d caught her up on the rest of it.\n",
      "She was as appalled as I had been the ﬁrst time I’d\n",
      "heard everyt hing from him, but then she decided she found\n",
      "the whole thing romantic.\n",
      "“So what’s going to happen now? Has he called you?”\n",
      "“It’s over,” I repeated, probably for the hundredth time.\n",
      "“He has no reason to call me.”\n",
      "I left out the fact that I’d waited for him to do exactly\n",
      "that the night before.\n",
      "“What about  this place? What will happen to the coﬀee\n",
      "shop?”\n",
      "“I don’t know ,” I mumbled.\n",
      "I truly didn’t know .\n",
      "The lunch rush started, and we didn’t have time to do\n",
      "anything but work our asses oﬀ the rest of the day. It was\n",
      "around six PM when she approached me with a weird look\n",
      "on her face.\n",
      "“Uh, Rose, did you say Jack waited for you that ﬁrst\n",
      "night outside?”\n",
      "“Yeah. Why?”\n",
      "“I think he started his shift again.”\n",
      "Trying my best to look like I was busy in the kitchen\n",
      "while Owen was out in the front—me actually doing nothing\n",
      "useful at all, of course—I decided to keep my hands occupied and started checking cupboards, because trying\n",
      "to look for nothing in order to look like you weren’t\n",
      "interested in what the other person was saying was always\n",
      "a fun idea. “ What are you talking about?”\n",
      "She waited until she had my full attention, and my heart\n",
      "had started beating too quickly to ignore her until she gave\n",
      "it up on her own.\n",
      "“I’m talking about him leaning against his car and just\n",
      "standing there, right now .”\n",
      "I didn’t have a single word to say to that other than\n",
      "rushing to the doorway and trying to spot him.\n",
      "“Are you going to talk to him?” Sally asked, coming to\n",
      "stand next to me—out in the open, like a norma l person.\n",
      "Owen glance d at us and then, after seeing us craning our\n",
      "necks, shook his head and kept chatting with a customer ,\n",
      "talking about the times the coﬀee shop was the least busy .\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "“Have a heart, woman. It doesn’t look like he’ll budge.”\n",
      "“It’ll be a long and cold night for him then.” I pressed\n",
      "my lips together to hide my ridiculously pleased smile.\n",
      "“Oh, come on. Can I at least take him some coﬀee? It’s\n",
      "freezing out there.”\n",
      "“It’s his coﬀe e shop. He paid for it, after all. If he wants\n",
      "to come in, I can’t stop him, but I’m not going to roll out\n",
      "the red carpe t either . I don’t care if you take him coﬀee or\n",
      "not.”\n",
      "“Rose—”\n",
      "“I love him, Sally,” I admitted, cutting oﬀ whatever she\n",
      "was about to say. “I love him, but I’m not ready to act like\n",
      "what he did didn’t hurt me or that it wasn’t wrong. I need\n",
      "him to understand what he did. I need him to take the time\n",
      "to think it through, and if that means he wants to come and\n",
      "wait outside  or something, he is free to do whatever he\n",
      "wants.”\n",
      "“So it’s not over . It’s over for now , but it’s not over .” I thought her words over as I watched Jack talking to\n",
      "someone on his phone. He didn’t see me watching him,\n",
      "taking in my ﬁll, but his eyes were deﬁnitely on the coﬀee\n",
      "shop.\n",
      "“I miss him,” I conceded into the silence.\n",
      "Sally pushed her arm through mine and rested her head\n",
      "on my shoulder . “Owen?”\n",
      "He looked at us over his shoulder .\n",
      "“I need you to start being romantic now,” Sally ordered,\n",
      "and my lips tipped up. She still hadn’t given up on him, and\n",
      "I thought Owen secretly enjoyed her attention.\n",
      "I cleared my throat before they started their usual back\n",
      "and forth. “If you happen to or decide to take coﬀee to Jack,\n",
      "don’t forget Raymond. Jack likes my— the lemon  bars,  and\n",
      "Raymond likes the triple chocolate brownies.”\n",
      "Sally snorted. “Right. I give it a week before you cave.”\n",
      "I gave her a murderous look. “K eep dreaming.”\n",
      "An hour later, I wasn’t sure if I was more annoyed with\n",
      "myself becau se my eye kept wandering over to where Jack\n",
      "was standin g, or if I was just annoyed with him for\n",
      "breaking my focus at work. I decided to head to Sally’s\n",
      "place so I could cook us dinner as a thank you for letting\n",
      "me stay with her .\n",
      "The second I stepped  outside, my heart started\n",
      "pounding in my chest. Jack straightened up the moment he\n",
      "saw me. I stood just a few feet away from him as we\n",
      "studied each other . If he had walked forward and said\n",
      "something, I wasn’t sure what I would’ve done. Maybe, like\n",
      "Sally had said, I would have caved, but he didn’t. So, I did…\n",
      "sort of, still leaving a healthy amount of space between us,\n",
      "enough for four people to easily walk through, actually .\n",
      "“What are you doing here, Jack?” I asked, raising my\n",
      "voice just a little.\n",
      "“Wanted to see you.”\n",
      "I opened my arms at my sides. “Now you did. Goodbye.” He was about to take a step forward when a group of\n",
      "girls walked between us, successfully blocking him.\n",
      "“How are you feeling?” he asked when it was just us\n",
      "again.\n",
      "“Oh, perfect. Just perfect. Having the best time of my\n",
      "life.”\n",
      "“I meant your head, your nose. Are you still getting\n",
      "dizzy? Headaches? Y ou look tired.”\n",
      "I tilted my head to the side, narrowing my eyes. “Thank\n",
      "you. As you know , it’s my default to look bad. You look like\n",
      "hell yourself .”\n",
      "His jaw clenched, a muscle ticking visibly . “You need to\n",
      "take better care of yourself ,” he forced out, his eyes\n",
      "blazing, as if he had any right to be angry with me.\n",
      "“No.” My eyes still on him, I shook my head. “Don’t do\n",
      "that. You don’t get to act like you’re worried about me,\n",
      "Jack.” I looked to the left and then the right. “There is no\n",
      "one around who knows us, so you can stop the pretending.”\n",
      "We studied each other in silence. I wasn’t sure if this\n",
      "would be the last time I’d ever see him. He could just wake\n",
      "up the next day and say, The hell with it, she isn’t—or, even\n",
      "worse— she wasn’t worth the trouble anyway . I had my fun\n",
      "with the business deal marriage. Now it’s time to move on.\n",
      "The thought  alone scared the bejesus out of me, but I\n",
      "wasn’t ready  to ignore everything and act like he hadn’t\n",
      "hurt me either . Therein lay our problem.\n",
      "“Go home, Jack,” I said quietly . “You have no reason to\n",
      "be here.”\n",
      "In the great scheme of things, we were nothing more\n",
      "than two people who had passed each other while walking\n",
      "through their lives. Couples broke up every day, and we\n",
      "were not special in that regard either . You cried yourself to\n",
      "sleep then woke up and went to work. When you repeated\n",
      "the cycle enough times, one day you woke up and suddenly\n",
      "it didn’t matter all that much. New people walked alongside you and eventually you forgot the ones you left\n",
      "behind.\n",
      "When he didn’t deny what I’d said, I let out a long\n",
      "breath, looked at his eyes for a moment longer to\n",
      "remember , and ﬁnally turned to leave.\n",
      "“I don’t have a home to go back to anymore, Rose.”\n",
      "I stopped, but didn’t look at him.\n",
      "“You’re my home,” he ﬁnished.\n",
      "My eyes ﬁlling with tears, I walked away .\n",
      "And he let me.\n",
      "So we ended  as we’d begun, nothing but two complete\n",
      "strangers.\n",
      "Closer to midnight, after Sally had gone to bed and I\n",
      "was getting ready to start another sleepless night,  I opened\n",
      "the curtains and the window so I could breathe in the cold\n",
      "air. Someone was walking across the street and for a\n",
      "moment I thought it was Jack, but then he walked under\n",
      "the light and I realized it was just a stranger .\n",
      "For a moment I was shocked, why would it hurt not to\n",
      "see him? Why would I be disappointed?\n",
      "During the week, he came to the coﬀee shop around\n",
      "closing time twice. He leaned against his car, then when\n",
      "Ray left he leaned against the lamp pole. Every time he\n",
      "showed up he made it harder to remember why I was so\n",
      "angry at him. He paced and waited. When I came out with\n",
      "Sally but didn’t stop to talk to him, he left.\n",
      "Then he disappeared for several days.\n",
      "It was the eighth day of our break up and we were\n",
      "getting ready  to close when he showed up again. All three\n",
      "of us were in the front. Owen and I were clearing out the\n",
      "dishes on the counter and taking them back into the\n",
      "kitchen, and Sally was stacking up clean coﬀee mugs and\n",
      "the to-go cups next to the espresso machine. We only had\n",
      "two customers in the shop, and both of them were regulars\n",
      "working on their laptops. The bell rang, and I looked up to see someone bundled\n",
      "up in her coat and scarf walk in and head straight toward\n",
      "one of the customers, so I got back to work.\n",
      "Sally was the ﬁrst one to notice Jack.\n",
      "“Rose.”\n",
      "I looked at her over my shoulder .\n",
      "“Yes?”\n",
      "“He’s here,” she whisp ered urgently , and I looked\n",
      "around in confusion until my eyes landed on him. My pulse\n",
      "picked up and my heart started to get all excited, but\n",
      "something was wrong. I couldn’t tell what he was thinking\n",
      "from his facial expressio n, because if there was one thing\n",
      "Jack Hawtho rne was good at, it was hiding his emotions.\n",
      "Dread and excitement over seeing him settled over me\n",
      "anyway as my heart betrayed me.\n",
      "He stood on the other side of the counter and I did\n",
      "nothing but stare at him, my heart pounding in my ears.\n",
      "I heard Sally clear her throat. “Hi, Jack.”\n",
      "He didn’t take his eyes oﬀ me when he answ ered.\n",
      "“Hello, Sally . You’re good, I hope.”\n",
      "“Yes. Great.”\n",
      "Then it was back to silence again.\n",
      "Feeling my chest tighten, I swallowed and wiped my\n",
      "hands on my jeans, managing to look away from his eyes.\n",
      "I saw his hand tighten around a stack of papers he was\n",
      "holding, creating a tube.\n",
      "“Uh, Owen did you take the—” I started in a low, rough\n",
      "voice, but Jack cut me oﬀ before I could ﬁnish my sentence.\n",
      "“If I could talk to you in private, Rose?”\n",
      "I looked back up at him, trying my best not to show that\n",
      "I had forgotten how to breathe like a normal person in the\n",
      "last minute or so . I cleared my throat and nodded.\n",
      "“Kitchen?”\n",
      "I nodded again and watched as he moved around the\n",
      "counter and walked straight back there. Sally bumped her shoulder into mine and smiled when I gave her a startled\n",
      "look.\n",
      "“You miss him. Be nice. I think you’ve made him suﬀer\n",
      "long enough. Y ou suﬀered enough as well.”\n",
      "I didn’ t respond, just turned to Owen. “I’ll, uh, I’ll be\n",
      "back in a minute. If you could just—”\n",
      "“I have  plent y of things to do out here. Go make up or\n",
      "whatever so we can breathe easy again.”\n",
      "I hit him on the shoulder as I walked past him into the\n",
      "kitchen. I only had enough time to take a deep breath\n",
      "before I was standing across from Jack again, this time with\n",
      "the island between us. I took in his dark grey suit, crisp\n",
      "white shirt, and black tie. He was made to wear suits and\n",
      "break my heart.\n",
      "I reached for a kitchen towel just to have something in\n",
      "my hands and looked away . While I was busy tryin g to ﬁnd\n",
      "the right words to apologize for what I had said at his\n",
      "oﬀice, Jack spoke up.\n",
      "“You can’t even look at me, can you?”\n",
      "Startled by his words, I met his gaze. Was that what he\n",
      "thought?\n",
      "“Jack, I—”\n",
      "“It doesn’t matter now,” he continued. “I came to give\n",
      "you this in person.” He unrolled the ﬁle in his hands and\n",
      "put it on the island, right next to the triple chocolate\n",
      "brownies, then pushed it my way .\n",
      "My eyes still on him, I reached for it.\n",
      "“What is this?” My voice came out like a whisper .\n",
      "When he didn’t answer , I looked down and turned the\n",
      "ﬁrst page.\n",
      "Shocked by what I was reading, my eyes ﬂew up to his.\n",
      "“Divorce papers,” he said calmly .\n",
      "I was anything but calm. My mind in overdrive, my eyes\n",
      "tried to follow the words and sentences, but it was all a\n",
      "jumbled mess in front of me. “You want a divorce?” I croaked out, the papers slightly\n",
      "trembling. I tightened my grip to hide it from his eyes.\n",
      "“Yes. It’s the right thing…for you.”\n",
      "My brows drew together and some heat started to come\n",
      "back to my limbs. I forced myself to drop the papers on the\n",
      "island and take a step back as if they would come alive and\n",
      "bite my ﬁngers oﬀ .\n",
      "This time I met his gaze straight on, the dread and\n",
      "excitement turning into anger . “For me. How about you?\n",
      "What do you get out of it?”\n",
      "He tilted his head to the side, his eyes slightly narrowing\n",
      "in a calculating manner . “It’s the right thing for me too .”\n",
      "A little dazed, I nodded. Barely able to speak through\n",
      "the tightness in my throat, I said, “I see.” Impressive word\n",
      "choices, I know .\n",
      "I was so out of it that I didn’t even notice him taking out\n",
      "a pen from his suit jacket and oﬀering it to me.\n",
      "I stared at him as if he had sprouted another head.\n",
      "“You want me to sign it…now .”\n",
      "It wasn’t a question, but he treated it as such.\n",
      "“Yes. I’d like to get it done right now .”\n",
      "“You’d like to get it done right now ,” I echoed.\n",
      "“Preferably .”\n",
      "That word—that one annoying word pushed me over the\n",
      "edge of worry and guilt into anger .\n",
      "Preferably .\n",
      "I decided right then and there that it was the most\n",
      "ridiculous and annoying word in the world. I didn’t touch\n",
      "the pen. I didn’t pick up the papers.\n",
      "I crossed my arms agains t my chest. “The right thing to\n",
      "do would’ve  been to be honest with me from the\n",

      "doing so. I stayed quiet. When I thought she would turn\n",
      "around, she picked up an apple and started washing them\n",
      "one by one. I counted four apples so far, and with each\n",
      "passing second, her frame stood more frigid.\n",
      "Then she turned oﬀ the water , picked up a kitchen\n",

      "“I didn’t.” There went her chin, up a little more. I studied her, a million thoughts running through my\n",
      "mind. “ What’s happening here?”\n",
      "She uncrossed her arms and held on to the edge of the\n",
      "kitchen counter . She was wearing her favorite black jeans\n",
      "that hugged every inch of her curves and a chunky  sweater\n",
      "that fell oﬀ of one of her shoulders. Half of her hair was up\n",

      "“I took vows.”\n",
      "That was what she came back with, and my brows drew\n",
      "in tighter .\n",
      "“Fake vows,” I countered, my voice coming out harsher\n",
      "than I had intended. I caught her ﬂinch but didn’t know\n",

      "“Where are you going with this exactly?”\n",
      "“I’m not going anywhere. That’s the point.”\n",
      "“I see. So what you’re saying is that you’re refusing to\n",

      "“Exactly .” She squared her shoulders, unknowingly\n",
      "pushing her breasts towa rd me. My eyes dropped from her\n",
      "gaze only for a moment. I took a step back. “And I’m moving back in.” She let go of the counter and\n",

      "I took back the space I’d created between us and put my\n",
      "hands on the counter behind her, trapping her between my\n",

      "mine and I could look into her beautiful, beautiful eyes.\n",
      "“What are you doing, Rose? Don’t make me ask again.”\n",

      "I waited for her to go on.\n",
      "“You never make anythin g easy, do you?” She sighed. “I\n",
      "happen to think a little ﬁghting is healthy in a marriage.\n",
      "First of all, it’s never good to hold things in, so you have to\n",
      "keep the lines of communication open if you want to last.\n",
      "Which you’re  not very good at, but you’ll start working on\n",
      "it. I’m sure.”\n",
      "“Explain why you’re not signing the papers,” I insisted.\n",

      "important.\n",
      "“Because I don’t want to get a divorce.”\n",
      "“It wasn’t a real marriag e. I lied to you. I tricked you\n",

      "“I would’ve never accept ed it. You knew it, you said so\n",

      "do.”\n",

      "else.”\n",
      "She shook her head, her eyes dropping to my mouth and\n",
      "then coming back to my eyes. Her chest had started to rise\n",
      "and fall faster . She shook  her head, a very small movement.\n",
      "Her shoulders were slightly trembling as well.\n",
      "“I don’t think you’d have the time, what with stalking me\n",
      "and all that.”\n",

      "“I think I can handle it. Go ahead.”\n",
      "“I…I didn’t have the best childhood, obviously . I lived in\n",

      "“You’re mine, too,” she said. “ You’re only mine.”\n",

      "over our kiss and deepened it.\n",
      "Her hand reached the bulbous head of my cock in the\n",

      "slowly slide down then back up again. She was my undoing.\n",
      "I only manag ed to withstand it for a few torturous drags\n",

      "her jeans and underwear then, grabbing her waist, I\n",
      "planted her naked ass back up there. Her eyes were still\n",

      "“Is that what you want?”\n",
      "“Yes.”\n",

      "so wet for me, incredibly tight and wet and all mine.\n",
      "Grabbing her calves, I wrapped them around my hips. Her\n",

      "millimeter separating us.\n",
      "Licking her neck and earning a soft moan, I started to\n",

      "him. He maintained eye contact the entire time as he\n",

      "“What am I missing?” Jack asked.\n",
      "I sighed. “ You’re missing young love—passion, tension.”\n",
      "“Young love? As opposed to our old love?”\n",
      "I grinned up at him. “You’re thirty-one years old and I’m\n",

      "People usually ﬁnd the age gap thing really sexy, especially\n",
      "if the guy looks anywhere near as good as you do .”\n",
      "He sighed and shook his head, which made me smile\n",
      "even more. “Okay , Mrs. Hawthorne, are you ready for our\n",

      "marriage is a serious business, Mr. Hawthorne.” Making\n",
      "sure I had my serious face on, I took a step back  from my\n",

      "Now done with the last of the customers, Sally joined us.\n",

      "“Yes, I would love one, Mrs. Hawthorne.”\n",

      "“I’m not sure if coﬀee is an innuendo for sex or you were\n",
      "just talking about real coﬀee.”\n",
      "“Unfortunately that was about real coﬀee.” As I went\n",
      "into the kitch en and placed the roses next to the sink, Sally\n",
      "followed me.\n",
      "“What’s with the diplomacy?” When I gave her a\n",
      "confused look, she explained. “Mr. Hawthorne, Mrs.\n",
      "Hawthorne…”\n",

      "Owen walked out of the stock room with a box full of our\n",

      "I leaned back against the counter and eyed Owen. “ What\n",
      "did you do now?”\n",
      "He rolled his eyes. “What makes you think I did\n",
      "something? I didn’t do shit. She’ll be back to norm al in an\n",
      "hour, don’t worry .”\n",
      "Since I believed he was right, because Sally was the last\n",
      "person on earth to hold a grudge against Owen, I let it go\n",
      "and left him alone. Grabbing a plate on my way out, I picked up the last two lemon muﬀins and started on Jack’s\n",

      "He had chosen the table nearest to the window and was\n",
      "following my every move  over the newspaper he had in his\n",
      "hands. Feeling heat rush to my cheeks under his gaze, I\n",
      "hurried and took my seat across from him as he folded the\n",
      "paper and placed it on the table.\n",
      "“They’re dating now,” I explained, answering his earlier\n",
      "question just in case I hadn’t been clear before.\n",
      "“I gathered that much. I’m not sure that’s a great idea.\n",
      "When something goes wrong, it’ll aﬀect your business.”\n",
      "“I love it when you’re being positive. And I know , but so\n",
      "far it hasn’t aﬀected their work, and they promised.”\n",
      "He gave me an exasperated look as if I was a fool for\n",
      "taking their word for it.\n",
      "“Plus, it’s not like I would ﬁre them for being in love. It’s\n",
      "fun listening to them bicker. Owen is a lot like you, actually ,\n",
      "so it’s extra fun because of that. Suddenly I’m surrounded\n",
      "by grumpy men.”\n",
      "“I’m not grumpy , Rose. I’m serious.”\n",
      "Laughing, I got up, leaned over the table, and quickly\n",
      "kissed his lips before taking my seat again. “And I love you\n",
      "just like that.” He was wearing my favorite navy blue suit.\n",
      "“Using everything you have in your arsenal for the\n",
      "negotiations, I see,” I commented lightly right before\n",
      "sipping from my tea.\n",
      "Jack’s brows drew together in confusion. “ What?”\n",
      "“Your suit—you know that’s my favorite one.”\n",
      "His eyes sparkled with mischief . “And you wore the\n",
      "dress I told you I’d prefer if you only wore when I was\n",
      "standing next to you, holding your hand.”\n",
      "I feigned shock and glanc ed down at my dress. “This old\n",
      "thing?” It truly was a pretty basic black wrap dress with\n",
      "long sleeves , but I knew he liked it for some reason. He\n",
      "couldn’t keep his hands oﬀ of me whenever I wore it. He arched one perfect eyebrow that basically said I\n",
      "know your game  and leaned back in his seat.\n",
      "“Would you like to start?”\n",
      "I push ed the muﬀins in front of him. Lemon week was\n",

      "“Would you like to taste these? I baked them.”\n",
      "“You can’t trick me with pastries, Rose. I’ll take them\n",
      "with me when I leave.”\n",
      "I smiled. “I would never , Mr. Hawthorne. I’m appalled\n",
      "that you’d even think I’d do something like that. Please go\n",

      "“Right. So, tell me, what kind of marriage do you want\n",
