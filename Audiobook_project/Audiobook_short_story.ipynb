      "And a full-on nightmare.\n",
      "Summer’s lips roll together, and she offers a small, fake smile. “Yes, of\n",
      "course.” I almost snort. Summer’s idea of feminine entertainment is squatting\n",
      "heavy plates at the gym and torturing grown men in the name of “personal\n",

      "Or maybe Lucy is being a snarky bitch to my future sister.\n",
      "“Alright.” I stand. “Well, thanks. We’ll get back to you.”\n",

      "And bedside manner isn’t my strong suit. I’m more of a rip-the-band-aid\n",

      "I saw her outstretched hand and just didn’t care to shake it. Practically\n",
      "stomping to the kitchen, I prop my hands against the butcher block counter\n",

      "This view, wild and craggy, is bursting with color in the early summer—\n",
      "grass a little too green, sky a little too blue, and sun bright enough to wash\n",
      "everything out a bit and make you squint.\n",

      "present for him.\n",
      "Basically, it’s not productive.\n",
      "The sound has the added benefit of drowning out the pleasantries that my\n",
      "dad and Summer are exchanging with Lucy at the front door.\n",
      "Not my house, not my responsibility. We’re doing the nanny interviews at\n",
      "the main farmhouse, where my dad lives, because I don’t like letting random\n",
      "people into my home. Especially not ones who look at me like this is their\n",

      "me.\n",
      "Harvey, on the other hand, would run a bed-and-breakfast out of this\n",
      "place and enjoy the hell out of taking care of people. Ever since he got\n",
      "injured and handed the ranch over to me, it’s like he just wanders around\n",
      "socializing 24-7.\n",
      "I watch the small grains tumble into the white paper filter in the\n",
      "coffeemaker's top and then swivel to fill the pot with water at the sink.\n",
      "“Kinda late in the day for a pot of coffee, don’t you think?” Harvey\n",
      "strides in, with Summer not far behind.\n",
      "They have no idea. I’m full up on coffee today. Almost jittery. “Just\n",

      "lips twitch when he sits down at the table and crosses a booted foot over his\n",

      "She does this sometimes and it’s unnerving.\n",

      "her head, but she doesn’t have a big mouth, so you never quite know what\n",
      "she’s thinking.\n",
      "I like her and I’m glad my little brother was smart enough to put a ring on\n",
      "it.\n",
      "“You’re nice,” she says thoughtfully, “in your own way.”\n",
      "I clamp my teeth onto my lip because I don’t want to give them the\n",
      "satisfaction of seeing I’m amused by that comment.\n",
      "She sighs. “Listen, that’s everyone we’ve interviewed. I went out of my\n",
      "way to weed out the applicants who seemed less interested in spending time\n",
      "with Luke and more interested in spending time with . . . you.”\n",
      "“Hoo boy”—Dad slaps the table—“and there were several. Who knew\n",
      "women would willingly sign up to endure your scowls and bad moods? The\n",
      "pay isn’t \n",
      "that \n",
      "good.”\n",
      "I scowl at him before turning my attention back to Summer. “You didn’t\n",
      "weed thoroughly enough. I want someone who has zero interest in me. No\n",
      "complicated shit. Maybe they could be happily married?”\n",
      "“Happily married women don’t want to live in your house for the\n",
      "summer.”\n",
      "I grunt. “What about someone from another town? Someone who doesn’t\n",
      "know our family. And all my shit. Someone who hasn’t slept with one of my\n",
      "brothers.” My nose wrinkles. “Or my dad.”\n",
      "Harvey makes a little choking sound, almost a laugh. “I’ve been single\n",
      "for decades, son. Mind your business.”\n",
      "Summer’s cheeks pinken, but I don’t miss the smile on her lips as she\n",
      "turns to peer out the window.\n",
      "“I could just do it, you know,” Harvey adds. And not for the first time.\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "“Why not? He’s my grandson.”\n",
      "“Exactly. That’s what your relationship should remain. You’ve done\n",
      "enough helping with him for his entire life. Your back, your knees—you need\n",
      "a rest. You can still have your fun days with him any time you want. But you\n",
      "don’t need to run yourself into the ground with long hours, early mornings, and possibly late nights. It’s not fair, and I’m not taking advantage of you\n",
      "that way. End of story.”\n",
      "Then I turn back to my future sister-in-law. “Summer, can’t you just do\n",
      "it? You’d be perfect. Luke loves you. You don’t like me. You already live on\n",
      "the ranch.”\n",
      "I see her jaw twitch. She’s getting sick of me asking her, but I don’t want\n",
      "to leave my boy with just anyone. He’s a handful. More than one handful.\n",
      "And I can’t accomplish everything I need to do on this ranch this summer\n",
      "without someone here to take care of him. Someone I can trust to keep him\n",
      "safe.\n",
      "“I’m also a new business owner, and these summer months are my\n",
      "busiest. It’s not an option. Stop asking. It makes me feel bad. Because I love\n",
      "you and Luke. But we’re getting tired of bending over backwards\n",
      "interviewing people just to make zero progress with you.”\n",
      "“Okay, fine,” I grumble. “I’ll settle for someone just like you, then.”\n",
      "Her head quirks in response to that, her body stilling. “I might have an\n",
      "idea.” She brings a finger up to tap it against her lips, and Harvey turns to\n",
      "her, eyes full of questions.\n",
      "He looks so damn hopeful. If I’m tired of the saga that is finding a new\n",
      "nanny for the summer, then Harvey must be downright exhausted.\n",
      "My eyebrows knit together. “Who?”\n",
      "“You don’t know her.”\n",
      "“Does she have experience?”\n",
      "Summer stares at me, wide, dark eyes giving nothing away. “She has\n",
      "experience with handling rowdy boys, yes.”\n",
      "“Will she fall in love with me?”\n",
      "Summer snorts in the most unladylike way. “No.”\n",
      "Her certainty should probably offend me, but I’m not bothered by it. I\n",
      "push off the counter and twirl a finger around. “Perfect. Let’s do it up,” I tell\n",
      "her as I march out the back door toward my house and away from the\n",
      "clusterfuck that is finding a capable nanny for a five-year-old boy.\n",
      "I just need someone to get in and get out. Someone professional and\n",
      "complication free.\n",
      "It’s only two months. It shouldn’t be that hard.\n",
      " I count in my head the last time I had sex.\n",
      "Or at least I try.\n",
      "Two years? Three years? Was it that one time in January when I spent a\n",
      "night in the city? How long ago was that even? What was that chick’s name\n",
      "again?\n",
      "The woman in front of me shifts, one hip popping out, full ass rounding\n",
      "out her skinny jeans in a way that should be illegal. The under-cheek crease is\n",
      "almost as alluring as the swing of her copper hair as it swishes across her\n",
      "slender back.\n",
      "She’s distracting. Tight shirt tucked into tight jeans. Every fucking curve\n",
      "on display.\n",
      "I lose count entirely. It’s the sight of her in front of me in line for coffee\n",
      "that has me counting anyway.\n",
      "The takeaway here is I had sex so far back now that I don’t even\n",
      "remember. But there’s no forgetting why I haven’t even let myself consider\n",
      "members of the opposite sex.\n",
      "A kid I’m raising on my own. A ranch I’m running on my own. A million\n",
      "responsibilities. Too little time. Not enough sleep.\n",
      "Time for myself hasn’t been a thing for a long time. I just didn’t realize\n",
      "how long.\n",
      "“What can I get you, ma’am?”\n",
      "The woman in front of me laughs, and it reminds me of the chimes on my\n",
      "back porch when the wind dances through them—melodic and airy sounding.\n",
      "What a laugh.\n",
      "It’s a laugh I’d recognize. I’ve definitely never met this woman. I’d\n",
      "remember it because I know everyone in Chestnut Springs.\n",
      "“Ma’am? I don’t know how I feel about that,” she says, and I swear I can\n",
      "hear the smile in her voice. I wonder if her lips match the rest of her.\n",
      "Ellen, who runs Le Pamplemousse, the little gourmet coffee shop in town,\n",
      "smiles at her. “Well, what would you have me call you? I usually recognize\n",
      "every face that walks in my door, but not yours.”\n",
      "Ah, it’s not just me. I lean forward a little, hoping to catch the name. But\n",
      "one worker chooses this exact moment to grind coffee. Which just makes me\n",
      "grind my teeth.\n",
      "I don’t know why I want to know this woman’s name. I just do. I’m from\n",
      "a small town, I’m allowed to be snoopy. And that’s all this is.\n",
      "When the grinding noise stops, Ellen’s wrinkled face lights up. “What a pretty name.”\n",
      "“Thank you,” the woman in front of me replies, before adding, “How\n",
      "come this place is called The Grapefruit?”\n",
      "Ellen barks out her amusement and grins from her side of the counter. “I\n",
      "told my husband I wanted to name the shop something that sounded fancy.\n",
      "Something French. He said the only thing he knows how to say in French is\n",
      "le pamplemousse\n",
      ". It seemed good enough to me and now it’s like a little\n",
      "running joke between us.” Her eyes soften at the mention of her husband, and\n",
      "I feel a flicker of envy inside of my chest.\n",
      "Followed by a flicker of annoyance.\n",
      "The only reason I haven’t grumbled about their slow-as-fuck chitchat is\n",
      "because I’m too busy fighting off a public boner over this chick’s laugh.\n",
      "Under normal circumstances, it would piss me off that grabbing a coffee is\n",
      "taking this damn long. I told my dad I’d be back to grab Luke—I check my\n",
      "watch—right about now. I need to get back so I can meet with Summer and\n",
      "the person who will hopefully be Luke’s nanny.\n",
      "But my mind is wandering in ways I haven’t let it in literal years. So\n",
      "maybe I’m meant to just enjoy the ride. Maybe it’s okay to let myself feel\n",
      "something.\n",
      "“I’ll grab a medium, extra hot, no foam, half sweet . . .” My eyes subtly\n",
      "roll back in my head as I tip the brim of my black hat down. Of course, the\n",
      "outsider with the rocking body must have an annoyingly long and\n",
      "complicated drink order.\n",
      "“That’ll be three dollars and seventy-five cents,” Ellen says, eyes fixed on\n",
      "the cash register’s touch screen in front of her while the woman at the till digs\n",
      "through her oversized purse, clearly searching for her wallet.\n",
      "“Oh shit,” she mutters, and from the corner of my eye, I see something\n",
      "fall from her purse to the polished concrete floor at her sandal-clad feet.\n",
      "Without even thinking about it, I drop into a crouch and swipe the black\n",
      "fabric off the floor. I see her legs turning and rise back up.\n",
      "“Here you go,” I say, my voice all gravel as a shot of nerves hits me.\n",
      "Talking to strange women isn’t a well-honed skill of mine.\n",
      "Scowling at them? I’m a professional.\n",
      "“Oh my god,” she says.\n",
      "Standing now, I get a good look at her face. My feet root to the ground,\n",
      "and my lungs stop working. Her laugh has nothing on her face. Cat-like eyes,\n",
      "arched brows, and milky skin. She’s fucking stunning.\n",
      "And her cheeks are fire-engine red.\n",
      "“I’m so sorry,” she gasps, hand falling across her rosebud lips.\n",
      "“No need. It’s fine,” I say, but I still feel like everything is happening in\n",
      "slow motion. I’m having a hard time catching up, still too fixated on her face.\n",
      "And \n",
      "fuck\n",
      ".\n",
      "Her tits.\n",
      "I’m officially a creepy old man. My eyes trail down to my fist, the soft\n",
      "fabric poking out from between my fingers.\n",
      "She groans as my fingers unfurl. And slowly but surely, I figure out why\n",
      "she’s acting so horrified over me being a gentleman and picking up her . . .\n",
      "Panties.\n",
      "I stare at the scrap of black fabric in my hand, and it’s like everything\n",
      "around us goes blurry. My eyes shoot to hers, all wide and green. So many\n",
      "shades. A mosaic.\n",
      "I’m not known for smiling, but the corners of my mouth twitch. “You, uh,\n",
      "dropped your panties, ma’am.”\n",
      "A strangled giggle bursts from her as her gaze darts to my hand and back\n",
      "to my face. “Wow. This is awkward. I’m really—”\n",
      "“Your coffee is ready, sweetheart!” Ellen calls.\n",
      "The redhead’s face flips away, relieved by the interruption. “Thank you!”\n",
      "she calls back a little too brightly before slapping a five down on the counter\n",
      "and grabbing the paper cup. Without another glance, she’s making a beeline\n",
      "for the door. Like she can’t get away fast enough. “Keep the change! See you\n",
      "again!”\n",
      "I swear I hear her giggling under her breath as she breezes past, clearly\n",
      "avoiding my gaze while murmuring something to herself about this being a\n",
      "good story to tell her kids one day.\n",
      "I absently wonder what the hell kind of stories this woman plans on\n",
      "telling her future children before I call out to her. “You forgot your . . .” I\n",
      "trail off because I refuse to shout this across the coffee shop full of people I\n",
      "have to face day in, day out.\n",
      "She turns and presses her back into the door as she leaves, holding my\n",
      "eyes for a beat, barely contained amusement touching every feature. “Finders\n",
      "keepers,” she says with a shrug.\n",
      "Now, she does laugh, full and warm and so damn amused. Then she exits\n",
      "into the sunlit street, hair shining like fire and hips swinging like she owns this town.\n",
      "She leaves me stunned.\n",
      "And when I glance back down at my open palm, it hits me she’s long\n",
      "gone. I have no idea what her name is, and I’m still here . . .\n",
      "Holding her panties. “W\n",
      "2\n",
      "Willa\n",
      "ho was he?” Summer’s voice is strangled.\n",
      "“Not a damn clue.” I think back on my black underwear\n",
      "plunking down on the floor and how mortification slowly\n",
      "morphed into hysterics.\n",

      "I smirk and take a sip of my beer. “No. He looked so . . . I don’t know.\n",
      "Stunned? Like not offended, but not pervy about it either. It was kind of\n",
      "adorable. I feel like I freed a house-elf or something.”\n",
      "“Did he resemble Dobby?”\n",
      "I groan and waggle my brows at her suggestively. “If Dobby was hot.”\n",

      "“Of course. They’re my spares. You know I don’t like wearing panties.\n",
      "But now and then, the need arises, you know?”\n",
      "Summer narrows her gaze in my direction. “I have that need every day.”\n",
      "“To be uncomfortable? No thanks. Life is too short. Bras and underwear\n",
      "are overrated. Plus, now I can lay awake at night and wonder what some\n",
      "rando is doing with them.”\n",
      "Summer just laughs again. “He probably threw them out like any sane\n",
      "person would.” She’s so happy these days. Since she left her strained family\n",
      "and overperforming city life. She met a bull rider and ran off into the sunset\n",
      "and now here she is. My best friend. All smiles and freckles and curled up on\n",
      "a porch swing in front of a beautiful, custom-built rancher that faces out over the Rocky Mountains.\n",
      "Nothing has ever looked better on her.\n",
      "I like to bug her about living in the middle of “buttfuck nowhere” but the\n",

      "it almost seems impossible. Dark, craggy mountains rising like a tidal wave,\n",
      "heading right for you.\n",
      "In the city, we can see the mountains, but not like this. Not like you could\n",
      "reach out and touch them.\n",
      "“So, what are you going to do about the next several months?”\n",
      "I sigh. I have no idea. But I also don’t want Summer worrying about me.\n",
      "It’s kind of her thing. She’ll get all worried, and then she’ll try to fix things\n",
      "for me when I’d just rather go with the flow.\n",

      "liquid inside isn’t even that cold anymore. It’s only June and already\n",
      "unseasonably hot. Jeans were a mistake.\n",
      "Taking a big pull, I roll my shoulders back. Ready to be scolded.\n",
      "“What if I had a way for you to live out here for the summer? But not\n",

      "“And where would I live?”\n",

      "his nights are late if something goes wrong. But he’s got a good crew hired\n",
      "on the ranch to offset his hours. Their dad likes to help with Luke, but\n",

      "When she puts it like that, it does sound kind of fun. More fun than\n",
      "spending the best months of the year in the city alone.\n",

      "Who am I to say no?\n",
      "“Well then, fuck it. I’m in.”\n",
      "We drive across the farm and pull up in front of the most picturesque red\n",

      "I’m instantly charmed.\n",
      "“I get to live here?” I ask as we climb out of her SUV, unable to tear my\n",

      "“Yeah.” Summer carries on, missing the part where I’m beyond charmed\n",
      "by the whole vibe out here. “I think his hours are so variable that it makes\n",
      "sense. Before we were tag teaming it with his dad and Mrs. Hill but waking\n",
      "up and getting over here at 4:30 a.m. is just too much for them. Cade doesn’t\n",
      "enjoy asking them to do it, but if you’re living here, you can just keep\n",
      "sleeping and then Luke won’t be alone in the house.”\n",
      "Summer saunters up to the front door without a care in the world, and I\n",
      "trail behind, wondering what the hell I’ve actually signed myself up for.\n",
      "I don’t know shit about taking care of kids.\n",
      "Or parenting. Or ranching.\n",
      "My steps falter as I fall behind, but Summer doesn’t notice. She marches\n",
      "up the couple of steps in her flip-flops and cutoff jeans to the front porch, lifts\n",
      "the knocker, and bangs hard.\n",
      "“Hey, Sum—” I start, reaching out with a hand as though I can stop her\n",
      "when she’s already knocked. Thinking that we should talk this through more\n",
      "thoroughly. Hammer out some details.\n",
      "Maybe my impulsiveness has gotten me in over my head for once. I\n",
      "almost feel like she’s rushing. Like she can’t wait to wrap this up. And I have\n",
      "questions.\n",
      "Lots of questions.\n",
      "But they all evaporate from my mind the minute the front door swings\n",
      "open, and I’m left standing stupidly in the middle of the dirt walkway,\n",
      "gawking at the man from the coffee shop.\n",
      "The one I left my panties with.\n",
      "He’s still all man, from head to toe. Dark hair, darker eyes under\n",
      "furrowed brows, broad shoulders, the sexiest scruff surrounding a slightly\n",
      "curled lip . . . and a scowl.\n",
      "He stares in my direction while his knuckles turn white where he grips the\n",
      "door.\n",
      "“Cade!” Summer starts in, oblivious to the death glare he’s pinning me\n",
      "with. “This is my best friend, Willa. Your new nanny.”\n",
      "“No,” is his only reply.\n",
      "“What do you mean, \n",
      "no\n",
      "?”\n",
      "“I mean, over my dead body.” Condescension drips from his words.\n",
      "Her head quirks to the side, and I close the space between us. If he thinks\n",
      "he’s going to talk to my best friend that way, he’s got another thing coming.\n",
      "I’ve had her back since we were teenagers. Summer’s endured enough shitty\n",
      "men in her life, so this one can fuck all the way off.\n",
      "“Cade, don’t be ridiculous. We’ve been trying to find someone for—”\n",
      "He cuts her off. “\n",
      "You’re\n",
      " being ridicu—”\n",
      "I step onto the porch, seeing red. No one else in my family has red hair,\n",
      "and I don’t know if it’s to blame for my fiery side, but I have been known to\n",
      "fly off the handle and hold a hell of a grudge.\n",
      "I’ve been known to break up bar fights with a bat.\n",
      "And maybe I’m about to be known for kicking a hot-as-hell rancher in the\n",
      "balls. I wave a hand right in front of him to shut him up. “Choose your next\n",
      "words carefully. I don’t care if she’s about to be your sister-in-law. No one\n",
      "speaks to her with that tone, period.”\n",
      "He turns his dark gaze on me now, eyes starting on my face before\n",
      "trailing down my body in the most critical and unnerving way. When his eyes\n",
      "come back up, the look in them is perfectly flat.\n",
      "Like he’s sized me up and found me entirely lacking.\n",
      "“And I don’t care if you’re her best friend. You smell like beer and your\n",
      "panties are still in my back pocket. You’re not taking care of my son.”\n",
      "My eyes narrow, and my lips curve up at his misstep. “You saving them\n",
      "for later?”\n",
      "I wink at him, watching fiery red splotches crop up on the apples of his\n",
      "cheeks and seep out across the immaculate bone structure hidden beneath that\n",
      "beard and scowl.\n",
      "Summer spins on me, chocolate eyes wide as saucers. She resembles one\n",
      "of those squishy-faced dogs whose eyes are constantly bugging out in the\n",
      "most adorable way. “Cade is the panty guy?”\n",
      "“I’m not the panty guy,” he interjects, but Summer and I ignore him.\n",
      "“Yeah. And you said that any sane man would have thrown them out. So\n",
      "you know what that means.”\n",
      "We’re grinning at each other like crazy people now, and before I know it,\n",
      "a giggle slips from between Summer’s lips. And before long, she’s doubled\n",
      "over, hands on her knees, gasping for air.\n",
      "“For fuck’s sake.” The grump runs a broad hand through his hair in\n",
      "frustration. “I am \n",
      "not\n",
      " the panty guy.”\n",
      "Laughter shakes my shoulders, and my eyes water as I mumble, “What\n",
      "are the chances?”\n",
      "“This is a small town. The chances are rather good,” Cade grits out, not\n",
      "nearly as amused as us.\n",
      "Summer practically howls as she straightens and swipes at her eyes.\n",
      "“Don’t worry, Cade. They’re clean.”\n",
      "His nostrils flare, and his eyes fall shut as he sucks in a deep breath. Like\n",
      "that might bring him some sort of peace.\n",
      "“Panty Guy.” I shake my head and grin at him. Nanny or not, I’ll be\n",
      "spending time around this man for the rest of my life with Summer being\n",
      "married to his brother, so I might as well smooth things out.\n",
      "“He’s not a panty guy! He wears boxers!” A small voice echoes from the hallway as the most adorable dark-haired, blue-eyed little boy comes blasting\n",
      "into view. “Those tight ones though,” he clarifies, adding insult to injury.\n",
      "“Yeah,” I deadpan to the little boy who’s now wedged himself under his\n",
      "dad’s arm. Big eyes regard me with keen interest. “Can’t have any chafing.”\n",
      "“What’s chafing?” he asks curiously, as his dad holds one broad, tanned\n",
      "hand up to his eyebrows and rubs at them.\n",
      "“Luke.”\n",
      "“Like when all your junk rubs together,” I explain.\n",
      "You don’t grow up around my parents and act shy about this stuff.\n",
      "Nothing is off the table in our family.\n",
      "“Oh yeah,” he nods, appearing wise beyond his years. “I hate it when that\n",
      "happens.”\n",
      "“Luke, back in your room.” Cade’s broad form has turned to face his son,\n",
      "and I can’t help but admire him. The strength he exudes. The ripple in his\n",
      "forearms. The way his Adam’s apple bobs. The way his eyes soften as he\n",
      "stares down at his son.\n",
      "That’s the real kicker.\n",
      "“Why?” This kid has his number though. Sapphire eyes widen almost\n",
      "dramatically, and his bottom lip pushes out ever so slightly. “I wanna go play\n",
      "with Summer and her friend.”\n",
      "He’s \n",
      "precious\n",
      ".\n",
      "“No,” his dad says, right as I say, “Sure!”\n",
      "Cade’s head snaps around, brows harsh slashes across his forehead, the\n",
      "lines there furrowed as though I’ve done something to personally offend him.\n",
      "“Cade.” Summer props her hands on her hips. “Just let him come hang\n",
      "out for a bit. Maybe it will be okay. Maybe you’ll be pleasantly surprised.”\n",
      "My eyes bounce between the two of them. Summer, all pint-sized and\n",
      "sweet, Cade, all big and growly.\n",
      "“Please, Dad?” When Luke’s sugary-sweet voice speaks, he doesn’t look\n",
      "so growly. He looks more . . . resigned. Tired somehow?\n",
      "Cade spins on me. “How old are you?”\n",
      "I straighten, refusing to cower under his piercing gaze. “Twenty-five.”\n",
      "His throat works as he assesses me again. “Do you have a criminal\n",
      "record?”\n",
      "“Not a substantial one,” I reply honestly. I got caught with pot once\n",
      "before they legalized it. Sue me for being a fun teenager.\n",
      "“Jesus Christ.” One thick hand runs through his closely cropped hair as he shakes his head.\n",
      "“Do \n",
      "you\n",
      " have a criminal record?” I cross my arms and arch an eyebrow\n",
      "back at him. If this is the brother I think it is, the one Summer has told me\n",
      "about, then I’m almost positive he’s not some walking, talking angel. And I’ll\n",
      "be the one stuck living with him.\n",
      "He stares at me. Hard. It feels like it lasts forever. Summer looks between\n",
      "us, and from the corner of my eye I see Luke peer up at his dad and tug at the\n",
      "hem of his shirt. “Can I go play now?”\n",
      "“Fine.” Cade glares at me when he says it. “But Summer is in charge.”\n",
      "The little boy squeals and launches off the front porch.\n",

      "I keep saying I need this, but now that I have it, I’m not so sure I\n",
      "like it.\n",
      "It turns out that after a lifetime of taking care of people, I’m not great at\n",
      "relaxing. I flick the TV on and try to find something to watch, but nothing\n",
      "appeals to me. I walk over to the bookshelf in my living room, stocked with\n",
      "some classics from my parents and some books I grabbed for myself along\n",
      "the way. Books I thought seemed interesting and then never made the time to\n",
      "read.\n",
      "I pull one out and flop down onto the couch with it. But when I do, I feel\n",

      ".\n",
      "I don’t even know her last name. I don’t know much about her, really. All\n",
      "I know is that she won’t be good enough to take care of Luke.\n",
      "She’s nothing like the uninteresting, responsible, asexual nun who also\n",
      "wants to do fun things with an active little boy I’ve had in mind for the job.\n",
      "I’m not delusional enough to think that person exists, but I keep hoping\n",
      "for that anyway. And Willa isn’t the answer I was hoping for.\n",
      "Luke’s mom did a number on us. She continues to do a number on us—\n",
      "on me.\n",
      "My trust levels are at rock bottom. I trust Mrs. Hill because I know she\n",
      "took good care of my brothers and me. Same goes for my dad. I trust Summer\n",
      "because anyone who can manage to tie my wild-child little brother down can\n",
      "handle an unruly five-year-old. But this Willa character. I don’t know her. I don’t trust her.\n",
      "All I know is that she makes my dick twitch, she talks too much, and she\n",
      "has a spare pair of underwear in her purse.\n",
      "I sit up and pull them out. It’s not like they’re anything offensive. A silky\n",
      "nylon type of black fabric. Pretty full cut. I guess. For panties? What the fuck\n",
      "do I know?\n",
      "I feel like the biggest perv, sitting here on my couch, scrutinizing a pair of\n",
      "underwear that belongs to the woman who is currently taking care of my\n",
      "child.\n",
      "I should give them back.\n",
      "I don’t want to keep walking around with them.\n",
      "I also don’t want to look her in the eye as I hand them back.\n",

      "women’s undergarments.\n",
      "Agitated with myself, I storm over to the kitchen and shove them all the\n",
      "way to the back of my “stuff” drawer. The one where random shit goes to die\n",
      "because I’m too lazy to think of a proper place to put it. I pride myself on\n",
      "keeping a tidy house, but that one drawer is my secret shame.\n",
      "It seems fitting that Willa’s underwear should end up in there.\n",

      "Summer and my dad hate me.\n",
      "Because I’m pretty sure if I draw this out much longer, they’ll both tell\n",

      "And I’ll deserve it.\n",
      "It only takes me a few minutes on the back road to reach Rhett and\n",
      "Summer’s brand-new house.\n",

      "Either way, it’s ever present. And it’s heavy.\n",
      "I stomp up the front steps of the house and bang on the door, even though\n",
      "there’s a bell. Hitting something is just so much more satisfying.\n",
      "Within a few moments, I hear feet padding from the other side of the\n",

      "gym.”\n",
      "I snort. “She’s not your wife yet. You aren’t married.”\n",
      "He laughs and waves me off, opening the door wider. “Details. She said\n",
      "yes. It’s pretty much done in my books. And it just sounds so good, you\n",
      "know?”\n",
      "I wrinkle my nose and stare back at my little brother. Never thought I’d\n",
      "see him this gone over a girl.\n",
      "“Is my kid with her?”\n",
      "“Oh, nah. He’s off with Willa. Summer said to remind you that you said\n",
      "she was in charge so she decided Willa would stay with Luke so she could\n",
      "work at her own business rather than as your personal assistant.”\n",
      "I roll my lips together and look back out over the wide-open farmland.\n",
      "That sounds \n",
      "exactly \n",
      "like something Summer would say. A loophole in my\n",
      "instructions that she would find.\n",
      "Rhett holds his hands up in surrender while trying to conceal his\n",
      "amusement. “Her words, not mine.”\n",
      "Propping my hands on my hips, I sigh before shifting my gaze back on\n",
      "Rhett and grit out, “Tell me about this Willa person. And where exactly is\n",
      "she?”\n",
      "“Come sit out back with me. You look like you need a beer. Or ten.”\n",
      "I shake my head as I step into the house. “I do not need ten beers.”\n",
      "Rhett chuckles as he saunters through the open-concept house to the\n",
      "kitchen, lined with glass doors that open wide onto the sprawling back deck.\n",
      "“Yeah. You do. You look like you could kill someone. It’s not good for your blood pressure. You aren’t getting any younger.”\n",
      "“Young enough to beat your ass,” I mutter as I toe off my boots and\n",
      "follow him through to the sunny deck.\n",
      "Within moments, Rhett tosses me a can of beer and steers me toward a\n",
      "chair facing the field that functions as their backyard. There is one lone tree.\n",
      "A huge willow with long sweeping branches that dangle all around, giving it\n",
      "an almost curtain-like effect.\n",
      "I crack the beer and put the cold can to my lips as Rhett sits in the\n",
      "Adirondack chair next to me. Summer painted them bright red, cheerful just\n",
      "like her.\n",
      "They remind me of Willa’s hair.\n",
      "Fucking lame\n",
      ". I push the thought away. And that’s when I hear it.\n",
      "“I can’t do it.” It’s Luke’s little voice, a hint of distress soaking through.\n",
      "“Yes, you can,” the slightly raspy tone of the knockout redhead comes\n",
      "next. And I almost shoot out of my seat to run to the rescue.\n",
      "“Man, just sit. He’s fine. Don’t be a helicopter parent. It’s annoying.”\n",
      "I ignore the instinct, take a big swig, and strain to hear what’s going on\n",
      "beneath the tree.\n",
      "“You won’t climb further than you can handle. You’re too smart for that.\n",
      "Trust your body.”\n",
      "“What if I fall?” Luke’s voice is thin.\n",
      "“Well, I guess I’ll stand underneath you and you can fall on me so that we\n",
      "both get hurt. Because you’re too big to catch. And you aren’t going to fall\n",
      "anyway. Just listen to me, okay?”\n",
      "“Okay,” he says, a surge of determination in his tone now.\n",
      "Rhett glances over at me and grins. “Willa Grant is good shit, brother. If\n",
      "she’s offering to take care of our boy for the summer, you’d be an idiot to\n",
      "turn her down. I don’t know many people more loyal than her. She’s got a big\n",
      "heart.”\n",
      "I feel like there’s a story there I don’t know. But I also know my brother\n",
      "wouldn’t blow smoke up my ass when it comes to Luke and his well-being.\n",
      "Her voice trails out from the tree again. “You’re going to move your right\n",
      "foot down to this branch.” A pause. “Attaboy. Then your left hand here. Then\n",
      "you should be able to sit on that branch and jump down.”\n",
      "I can see her sandaled feet and tight jeans behind the branches as she\n",
      "moves around pointing things out to my son. Soon, small sneakered feet\n",
      "plunk down beside her, followed by little hands catching in the grass. “I did it!” Luke shoots up, still oblivious to the fact that I’m here.\n",
      "“Of course, you did. You made this tree your bitch.”\n",
      "Rhett snorts beside me and I glare at him.\n",
      "“Oh, come on! You think he hasn’t heard the way you talk?”\n",
      "“I’ve spent years instilling good manners in that kid.”\n",
      "He chuckles and shrugs. “Well, if that’s true, then you’ve laid a good\n",
      "foundation, and one summer with a fun nanny won’t ruin him.”\n",
      "I just grunt and take a sip.\n",
      "Maybe.\n",
      "“How high can you go, Willa?”\n",
      "I expect her to shut him down. Or appease him with some line about how\n",
      "adults don’t climb trees. But she wipes her hands over the round globes of her\n",
      "jean-clad ass and says, “I dunno. Let’s see.”\n",
      "I hold my beer suspended in midair—frozen—as I watch an adult woman\n",
      "climb the thick trunk. “Is she nuts?” I mutter before taking another drink.\n",
      "Rhett snorts. “A little. But in a good way.”\n",
      "Luke’s feet bounce excitedly as he watches her. “Don’t go too high! What\n",
      "if you get stuck?”\n",
      "“You’d save me,” Willa calls back from what sounds like much higher up\n",
      "the tree than I thought she’d go.\n",
      "“I’m too small. But my dad would save you!”\n",
      "Her raspy laugh reaches us at the back deck. It’s still as disarming as it\n",
      "was earlier today. “I don’t know about that. He might be happy to leave me\n",
      "up here, Luke.”\n",
      "I press my lips together. She’s not entirely wrong. My life would be a lot\n",
      "less complicated if she hadn’t waltzed into Chestnut Springs this morning.\n",
      "My dick would be a lot softer too.\n",
      "“Oh never. He helps everyone,” my son replies, making my heart twist in\n",
      "my chest. Sometimes I wonder how I must seem to him, how I look in his\n",
      "eyes. And this one gets me right in the gut.\n",
      "“Sounds like you’ve got a pretty great dad,” Willa replies instantly,\n",
      "sounding a little breathless now. “How lucky are you?”\n",
      "“Yeah . . .” Luke trails off thoughtfully. “No mom though. She moved\n",
      "away and doesn’t visit.”\n",
      "My brother sucks in a breath from beside me, eyes darting in my\n",
      "direction. “Goddamn, kids just say whatever comes to mind, don’t they?”\n",
      "I swallow thickly and nod. I’ve worked hard to shield Luke from the reality of his mom, of the choices she’s made—the type of person she is.\n",
      "I never want him to feel unwanted.\n",
      "Willa drops to the ground, brushes her hands against each other, and\n",
      "crouches in front of my son. Her head tips up to look him in the eye, hands\n",
      "stroking his upper arms as she smiles at him.\n",
      "“Sounds like her loss, because you might be the coolest kid I’ve ever\n",
      "met.”\n",
      "She doesn’t use a sad voice, or a baby voice, she just talks to him like a\n",
      "normal human being.\n",
      "“Fucking hell,” I curse under my breath because she just practically hired\n",
      "herself. I\n",
      "4\n",
      "Willa\n",
      "swallow hard when Luke pushes his soft little fingers between my own. I\n",
      "also swallow down the agitation I feel at the thought of someone—a\n",
      "mother, no less—not coming to visit a kid like this.\n",
      "The universe blessed me with two badass parents. Ones who would crawl\n",
      "through glass to get to me. I want to be that kind of mother one day. Fierce.\n",
      "Fearless.\n",
      "Sucking air in through my nostrils, I remind myself that it’s not my\n",
      "business. That I don’t know the full story. That maybe there’s a good reason\n",
      "for whatever’s going on with his mom. But his voice is so sweet, and his\n",
      "hand is so chubby, and he’s been cracking my shit up since he announced his\n",
      "dad wears boxers and not panties.\n",
      "I don’t really consider myself a kid person, not in the mushy, heart-eyed\n",
      "kind of way. Haven’t spent enough time around them to know for sure if I\n",
      "am. Usually I just talk to them like tiny adults. But after years of bartending, I\n",
      "know \n",
      "people\n",
      ". And no matter what his age is, Luke is a cool person.\n",
      "Giving his hand a quick squeeze—that he almost instantly returns—I pull\n",
      "back the curtain of branches, only to find Rhett and Cade sitting in two red\n",
      "chairs staring at us.\n",
      "The similarities in their body language are impossible to miss. But where\n",
      "Rhett is all smiles, Cade is all scowls.\n",
      "All thick arms and broad chest and furrowed brow. Dirty boots. Muscular\n",
      "thighs.\n",
      "Cowboy porn with a frown.\n",
      "“Dad!” Luke calls, darting toward the deck. “Did you see me? Did you\n",
      "see Willa? She climbed \n",
      "so \n",
      "high. I wanna learn to climb that high. Uncle Rhett, how high can you climb?”\n",
      "“Can we not ask the daredevil in this family that question?” Cade mutters,\n",
      "but he doesn’t look at his son. No, his eyes latch onto me.\n",
      "Rhett pushes up to his feet beside me. “I don’t know, pal. Why don’t we\n",
      "go see?”\n",
      "Luke bounces in place. “Really?”\n",
      "“Absolutely, little man.” Rhett sets down his can of beer and pads across\n",
      "the deck barefoot while Luke turns and races back to the tree. “Let’s go!\n",
      "Gotta let the panty bandit here chat with Willa.”\n",
      "“Jesus Christ. They already told you about that?” Cade grumbles as a\n",
      "laugh rumbles in Rhett’s chest.\n",
      "Cade’s eyes snap to mine, and I bite down on my bottom lip to keep from\n",
      "smiling as I continue to walk toward him. Then his gaze drops, and it’s like\n",
      "he can’t peel his eyes away from my mouth.\n",
      "I push my teeth down until it almost hurts and drop his intense stare.\n",
      "Within a few more steps, I’m folding myself down into the seat beside\n",
      "Cade. “I’m not sold on you, really,” I start, even though I’m almost positive\n",
      "this man doesn’t give a flying fuck what I think of him, “but your kid is\n",
      "something else.”\n",
      "I peek out the corner of my eye and can’t help the twitch of my lips as I\n",
      "take in his deep frown.\n",
      "“Thanks,” he eventually grumbles, clearly irritated by me, but not enough\n",
      "to be rude after I pay him a compliment. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to\n",
      "tell that Cade Eaton’s favorite thing in the world is his son.\n",
      "My immediate connection with Luke seems to give me brownie points by\n",
      "proxy or something.\n",
      "I dip my chin, still watching Rhett and Luke across the yard. I don’t want\n",
      "to let my eyes linger too long on Cade Eaton. He’s so bitchy looking that I\n",
      "might laugh, or I might stare longer than is appropriate. Because you’d have\n",
      "to be dead to not enjoy staring at him.\n",
      "He’s got an intimidating vibe about him. Like a hot, mean teacher.\n",
      "“I’m out of work for the summer,” I say casually, noting the way the\n",
      "veins in his hand ripple when he tightens his grip on the beer can. “My show\n",
      "horse is rehabbing from an injury and needs a few months off. My best friend\n",
      "in the world fell in love with a cocky cowboy and moved away. My brother\n",
      "got famous almost overnight and is a full-blown workaholic. And my parents\n",
      "are retired and gallivanting around the globe.” I chance a look up at the dark, foreboding man beside me. Even sitting, he\n",
      "seems tall. One dark brow arches at me while his facial expression remains\n",
      "impassive.\n",
      "A quiet beat turns into an awkward silence. And I hate awkward silence.\n",
      "I flip a hand over as though I’m showing him something. “So I’m free.”\n",
      "He just glares at me.\n",
      "“If you need a nanny. I could help.”\n",
      "He continues to glare, and I can’t help but roll my eyes. “Good God. Does\n",
      "it hurt if you smile? Or say something polite? What happened to the \n",
      "ma’am\n",
      "guy from the coffee shop?”\n",
      "“You’ll keep him safe?” His voice is all gravel, his eyes like lasers tracing\n",
      "my features. And if he weren’t such a grumpy asshole, this whole\n",
      "overprotective dad vibe would totally do it for me.\n",
      "I nod. “Absolutely.”\n",
      "His gaze, full of questions and devoid of warmth, roams over my face,\n",
      "searching for something. “Will you teach him how to knit?”\n",
      "My nose wrinkles. “Is that . . . is that like a requirement? Can I outsource\n",
      "it? I’m uh . . . not really big on knitting.”\n",
      "I swear I see a cheek twitch.\n",
      "“What will you do with him?”\n",
      "I blow a raspberry and flop back in the chair. “I mean, the options are\n",
      "endless. I’m never bored. Does he ride yet? I could give him riding lessons. I\n",
      "could show him my guitar. Does he like music? I love music. Playdates with\n",
      "some other kids? Cooking? Ooh! I love to bake. How about garden? I bet you\n",
      "could grow some killer veggies out here.”\n",
      "All I get is a small bob of his head.\n",
      "“You would send me frequent text updates. I leave early in the morning\n",
      "but like to be home early enough to spend time with him in the evenings. I\n",
      "will do my best to give you weekends off. I know you’re young and probably\n",
      "want to maintain some sort of social life.”\n",
      "I shrug and chuckle. I started bartending at eighteen. Seven years later,\n",
      "my desire to go out and party is pretty much shot.\n",
      "I’ll take a boozy brunch with my bestie and a dirty book in bed by eight\n",
      "for a thousand, Alex.\n",
      "“Not especially.”\n",
      "Cade gazes out over the back yard, laughter bubbling from under the big\n",
      "willow tree. “Okay.” I sit up straight. “Okay?”\n",
      "He nods once, decisively.\n",
      "“Is that okay like, \n",
      "Willa will you please come help me this summer\n",
      "because I would appreciate it so much\n",
      "?”\n",
      "He rolls his eyes like I exasperate him. And I’m pretty sure I do. I might\n",
      "even be trying a little bit. I like the way the muscle in his jaw pops, the way\n",
      "his Adam’s apple bobs beneath tawny, tanned skin.\n",
      "I even like the little shimmer of silver strands dusted throughout his dark\n",
      "hair.\n",
      "Older guys. They’ve always done it for me.\n",
      "Cade glances my way now, all raspy, rugged voice and resting bitch face.\n",
      "“I would appreciate your help this summer, Willa. But—”\n",
      "I hold up a hand. “No buts. That was very polite. Excellent work. I’ll be\n",
      "back tomorrow and can start then. The way I understand it, you need\n",
      "someone right away, yes?” I push to stand, knowing I shouldn’t overstay my\n",
      "welcome or let him get too many demands in.\n",
      "I can already tell he’s \n",
      "that\n",
      " type of man. Exacting. Specific. Knows what\n",
      "he wants and expects you to deliver.\n",
      "“Yes,” he bites out, eyes perusing my body critically.\n",
      "I give him a cheery thumbs up, not sure what to make of him. Not sure it\n",
      "matters since I’ll spend most of my time with his son anyway. “See you\n",
      "tomorrow, then. I’ll get your number from Summer and let you know where\n",
      "I’m at.” I turn to leave, mentally running through all the things I need to do to\n",
      "get ready. For some people, uprooting their life at the drop of a hat would be\n",
      "stressful. They’d need lists and plans.\n",
      "But not me. I’ve always flown by the seat of my pants. No idea where I’m\n",
      "going, just kind of . . . along for the ride. Life is more exciting this way\n",
      "anyhow. Jobs, men, material shit, none of it seems permanent for me yet.\n",
      "My dad says I’m unsettled. My mom says I just haven’t found a place I\n",
      "want to settle down yet. And I think she’s right. Plus, the pressure of\n",
      "succeeding the way everyone else in my family has is downright crippling.\n",
      "Undecided seems easier than failing.\n",
      "Right when I get to the back door I hear, “Willa.” Cade says my name\n",
      "like it’s a demand. “You need to wear proper undergarments while you’re at\n",
      "work. You can’t be dropping them out of your purse around a child.”\n",
      "I swear my feet grow roots and my jaw drops. \n",
      "The fucking nerve.\n",
      "If I didn’t actually kind of want this gig, I’d march over there and lay into him for being an overstepping, presumptuous prick.\n",
      "Undergarments\n",
      ". What year even is this? And why would they traumatize\n",
      "a kid?\n",
      "He might technically be my employer for the next couple months, but I’m\n",
      "the one doing him a favor. I don’t need the income; I just need a purpose. So\n",
      "I opt to do what will piss him off even him even more.\n",
      "I rise above.\n",
      "Well, sort of.\n",
      "I plaster on the sweetest smile I can muster and turn to look back over my\n",
      "shoulder. “I’ll be ready for your inspection tomorrow, boss.”\n",
      "Then I wink and saunter away, feeling the weight of his gaze on my body\n",
      "and knowing he’s probably wondering if I’m wearing any \n",
      "undergarments\n",
      "right now. I\n",
      "5\n",
      "Cade\n",
      "Summer:\n",
      " She’s going to be great. You’re going to love her.\n",

      " Po-tay-to, po-tah-to! Just be nice.\n",
      "Cade:\n",
      " I am nice.\n",

      " No. You’re kind of an asshole.\n",

      " With family like you telling me things like this, I just can’t imagine\n",
      "why.\n",
      "Summer:\n",

      "But I am.\n",
      "She grates on my nerves, sure. But my kid seems to like her and I’m\n",
      "still a gentleman at my core.\n",
      "I pull my cell phone out of my back pocket and check the time. My\n",
      "countdown is on. She seems like the type of person who would be late.\n",
      "Scattered. Disorganized.\n",
      "Or maybe I just want her to be so I can be justified in not liking her. If\n",
      "she’s late the first time we make an agreement, I’ll be able to show everyone\n",
      "that I was right. That she isn’t responsible enough to take care of Luke.\n",
      "Truthfully, I don’t know who is. I don’t trust easily. Especially not women.\n",
      "She has six minutes.\n",
      "I smile to myself, prop a hip against the banister, feeling like there’s a\n",
      "good chance I’ll be right.\n",
      "And it’s at that moment the crunching of gravel draws my gaze up.\n",
      "It’s at that moment I’m proven wrong.\n",
      "Because Willa’s red Jeep is rolling down my driveway five minutes early.\n",
      "She pulls right up beside my black truck and hops out. I stare at her feet,\n",
      "starting at her Converse sneakers, letting my eyes trail up long, slender legs\n",
      "to simple denim cutoffs topped with an oversized, distressed Led Zeppelin\n",
      "shirt. There’s a hole in it near her stomach, and I can see a little peek of milky\n",
      "skin through it.\n",
      "Big Ray-Ban aviators sit on her nose, and her coppery hair is wild and\n",
      "wavy around her shoulders. It frames her delicate face like dancing flames. A\n",
      "wisp of it blows across her lips.\n",
      "The lips that are all glossy and tipped up in a smirk.\n",
      "“You’re early,” I growl, because I don’t know what else to say. I can’t\n",
      "peel my eyes off of her, even though I want to. Even though she’s not at all\n",
      "my type at this point in my life.\n",
      "She has city girl written all over her. She has wild child written all over\n",
      "her. She’s not some sweet, small-town girl.\n",
      "She’s the girl who told me she’d be ready for me to inspect her\n",
      "undergarments and didn’t think twice about it.\n",
      "She has temptation written all over her.\n",
      "But she doesn’t act like it, instead she shrugs and pulls her sunglasses off\n",
      "her face, pinning me with her emerald eyes. The kind of eyes that stop you in\n",
      "your tracks.\n",
      "If nothing else, Willa Grant is a stunner.\n",
      "Too young for me. Too unpredictable for me.\n",
      "But a stunner all the same.\n",
      "“I was excited to get out here.”\n",
      "I blink at her because, well, what am I supposed to say to that? I’m here\n",
      "counting all the ways in which she’s a problem for me, and she’s just excited\n",
      "to be here and take care of my child.\n",
      "Maybe I am the asshole everyone tells me I am.\n",
      "“Willa!” Luke comes tearing out of the house like a bat out of hell,\n",
      "socked feet straight down the dirt path and onto the gravel driveway. He knows better but hasn’t stopped talking about Willa since she left yesterday.\n",

      "Willa laughs, all pretty and sexy, with a little rasp—like she smokes or\n",
      "something. And I’m wondering if she does. I didn’t ask her if she smokes.\n",

      "“What are we going to do?” His eyes go all sparkly, excitement pouring\n",
      "off him.\n",

      "My brows furrow from their own fruition. I want Luke to have fun, but\n",
      "not \n",
      "too \n",
      "much fun.\n",
      "She reads my expression because her eyes twinkle with amusement.\n",
      "“Cliff diving. Bull riding. I’ll even teach you how to shotgun a beer.”\n",

      "She’s going to drive me up the fucking wall.\n",
      "Luke’s nose wrinkles. “Beer is gross.”\n",

      "“Of course!” my son’s sugary voice exclaims as he slides his hand into\n",
      "hers without hesitation.\n",

      "them, I grumble, “I’ve got this.”\n",
      "“Very chivalrous. Thank you, Mr. Eaton.”\n",
      "I bite down on the inside of my cheek. \n",
      "Mr. Eaton. \n",
      "That makes me feel\n",
      "like an old perv.\n",
      "Or like my dad. Which is possibly the same thing.\n",
      "But I don’t correct her, because the old perv part of me likes it. Instead, I\n",
      "open the back hatch and pull out her massive suitcase.\n",
      "“I want to show you my room!” Luke says, like an excited squirrel with a\n",
      "nut that can’t figure out where to put it.\n",
      "It’s honestly kind of endearing.\n",
      "I heave the suitcase out just in time to watch them walk hand in hand into\n",
      "my house, and for some reason, I stop and watch. Unable to look away. Lots of people have walked through that front door.\n",
      "But somehow this feels different.\n",
      "“In bed by eight.”\n",
      "Willa nods, face perfectly serious even though I’m pretty sure there’s a\n",
      "part of her that’s mocking me. “Okay.”\n",
      "We’re sitting across from each other at the white oval table in my living\n",
      "room, facing off now that Luke is asleep for the night. Willa has crossed her\n",
      "forearms over each other, and I’m still trying to steal glimpses of her skin\n",
      "through the hole in her T-shirt.\n",
      "“No sugar after dinner.”\n",
      "She rears back, eyes widening. “Not even dessert?” She sounds like I’ve\n",

      "“Not on weeknights.”\n",
      "“You rule with an iron fist, Daddy Eaton.”\n",
      "I groan, cheeks pinching up in distaste. “That’s what we call my dad.”\n",

      "top. “Daddy Cade it is.”\n",
      "I’m not sure what I did to deserve this torture, but it must be something\n",
      "terrible. I like to think I’ve lived a straight and narrow sort of life, yet I’ve\n",
      "been handed heartache after heartache, challenge after challenge. It seems\n",
      "like the universe could have granted some sort of reprieve.\n",
      "But it granted me Willa fucking Grant.\n",
      "“No.”\n",

      "“Is this something his teachers do for you while he’s at school?”\n",

      "Maybe it was a dick thing to say, but I’m not known for giving people the\n",
      "warm and fuzzies. Every time I’ve done that, I’ve walked away a little less whole than I started.\n",
      "Never again.\n",
      "I’ve got nothing left to give if Luke wants a dad who can be happy and\n",
      "present.\n",

      "I lift one shoulder carelessly. “Sure did.”\n",
      "The smile she gives me is flat, her eyes dull—all traces of playfulness\n",
      "evaporated. “Well, in that case, I’ll be going.”\n",
      "She scoots her chair away efficiently, pushes to stand, spins on a heel and\n",

      "“Willa.”\n",
      "She deposits her glass of water in the sink but ignores me.\n",
      "“Willa.”\n",
      "She ignores me and turns to head down the hall toward the guest bedroom\n",
      "where Luke so happily helped her get settled a couple of hours earlier. I could\n",
      "hear him chattering away at her. Asking her about her horse. About her\n",
      "guitar. About what her favorite type of snake was. Like that’s a normal\n",
      "question you ask when getting to know someone.\n",
      "If I didn’t think it would wake Luke up and upset him, I’d raise my voice\n",
      "right now. But I’m stuck whisper-shouting “Willa” and she’s not fucking\n",
      "listening.\n",
      "With a growl, I stand and stride after her. Past Luke’s room and right to\n",
      "the door of her bedroom that veers off the long hallway before it would lead\n",
      "to my master bedroom at the very end.\n",
      "“Willa.” I catch the door just before she can quietly close it. Obviously,\n",
      "she’s trying not to wake my son as well, something I appreciate, because he\n",
      "doesn’t need to be a part of this conversation.\n",
      "I stand on the hardwood floor of the hallway, and she stands on the carpet\n",
      "in the bedroom. A brass divider shines on the ground between us like a line in\n",
      "the sand. Me versus her.\n",
      "“What are you doing?” I ask.\n",
      "“Leaving,” she deadpans.\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "Her eyes roll as she turns away from me and starts setting things back\n",
      "into her barely unpacked suitcase. “Because I’m not spending my summer\n",
      "living with a woman hater who doesn’t trust me and will be an over-the-top\n",
      "control freak the entire time I’m here.” I lurch back a little like she’s slapped me. “I’m not a woman hater.”\n",
      "She bends over to grab a pair of pink, fluffy slippers. The kind that would\n",
      "melt into plastic in the heat of a fire. I try not to fixate on the way her shorts\n",
      "creep up the smooth skin on her thighs. “You should try harder not to look at\n",

      "It’s not the first time people have told me this. But it’s the first time I’ve\n",
      "faced the reality of how it might make them feel. It’s not intentional. I’m\n",
      "pretty sure it’s just my default facial expression now. My smiling muscles\n",
      "have lost all their tone.\n",
      "“I don’t hate you.”\n",
      "She rises, a wry laugh twisting her features as her copper waves fly\n",

      "“I’m sorry.”\n",
      "Her chin juts out, and she holds up a hand to her ear. “Pardon? I think I\n",
      "misheard that.”\n",
      "“I’m. Sorry.” I bite out. “I’m having a hard time letting him go.”\n",
      "I watch her shoulders fall as she hisses out a sigh. “That’s fair. But there’s\n",
      "no amount of money in the world you could pay me to stay here and be your\n",
      "punching bag all summer.”\n",
      "I fucking love the pair on this girl. If I weren’t so irritated by how\n",
      "attracted I am to her, I’d be cheering her on.\n",
      "I glance over my shoulder toward Luke’s room, where my entire world is\n",
      "sleeping. The little boy who is excited at the prospect of spending the next\n",
      "couple of months with the firecracker in front of me.\n",
      "“Stay,” I mutter, holding a hand up to stop her and staring down at that\n",
      "line on the floor. The one stopping me from storming in there and dragging\n",
      "her back out to the table and forcing her to listen to me.\n",
      "She stops shoving stuff into her bag and turns to face me, crosses her\n",
      "arms beneath her generous breasts and cocks a hip. If attitude were a person,\n",
      "she’d be it.\n",
      "“Beg.”\n",
      "“Pardon me?”\n",
      "“You heard me.” Her lips don’t even twitch. She’s not joking at all.\n",
      "“Beg.”\n",
      "My cheeks heat against my will. My heart thunders in my chest. She’s got\n",
      "me so on my heels it’s not even funny. I can’t allow it to last. But can I suck\n",
      "it up for the sake of making her turn her ass around? Maybe.\n",
      "“Please stay.”\n",
      "She doesn’t react other than to arch an eyebrow.\n",
      "“Don’t leave.”\n",
      "Her lips roll together in the most distracting way.\n",
      "I sigh, propping my hands on my hips and staring up at the stippled\n",

      "“Luke is everything to me, and I want him to have a fun summer. Proper\n",
      "fun. Sometimes he’s stuck out on this ranch with a bunch of adults, and I\n",
      "worry he doesn’t get enough attention from me because I work such long\n",
      "hours. And I need \n",
      "help\n",
      " because it’s all just way too much. I’m fucking\n",
      "exhausted.” My chin drops, and I look her in the eye. “I really need your\n",
      "help. Please stay.”\n",
      "The column of her throat shifts, and her eyes take on a slightly glassy\n",
      "quality. With a few soft steps, she comes to stand right in front of me. She\n",
      "smells like citrus and vanilla. Like some fancy pastry at the coffee shop in\n",
      "town. I can’t help but lean in just a little bit.\n",
      "She draws close. It almost feels too close in the dimly lit room. Too\n",
      "intimate in the quiet house. It feels like the kind of moment where you could\n",
      "make a mistake and no one would ever know.\n",
      "And maybe I already made a mistake tonight, or maybe I’m about to\n",
      "make one. Usually I’m so sure of myself. But in this instance, I’m struggling\n",
      "to tell right from wrong.\n",
      "“Fine.” She sticks her hand out to me, and I instantly let my palm meet\n",
      "hers. I can feel the dainty bone in her wrist against the pads of my calloused\n",
      "fingers. “I will send you texts. I will keep him \n",

      "“Why are we sorry?”\n",
      "I sigh deeply, shaking my head and sawing into my chicken breast with\n",
      "altogether too much force. “Luke has already asked to throw lettuce heads out\n",
      "the window and I told him no.”\n",
      "Luke can’t even hold my eyes, and Willa’s jaw drops as she stares back at\n",
      "him. “Dude! Seriously?”\n",

      "he’s just got a little bit of a rebellious streak. I guess he comes by it honestly\n",
      "as an Eaton boy.\n",
      "“I thought Dad meant \n",
      "he \n",

      "on Willa. “You said you had fun doing it!”\n",
      "“Luke—” I start but Willa cuts in.\n",
      "“We both know you’re smarter than that, Luke. You tricked me. On\n",
      "purpose. Not cool. I had fun, but knowing that you lied to me about it ruins\n",
      "all the fun.” She says it with nothing mean in her tone, but Luke looks\n",
      "devastated.\n",
      "I lean back in my chair, crossing my arms over my chest, a little surprised\n",
      "by her taking this seriously rather than laughing me off. And a little relieved\n",
      "that I don’t have to lay into him—again.\n",
      "“I’m sorry.” His eyes are instantly shrink-wrapped. He’s a sensitive kid.\n",
      "It doesn’t take much to put him back in place.\n",
      "Willa nods, taking another green bean between her lips. “I know you are.\n",
      "You’re a good person. But when you trick me, it breaks my trust. And your\n",
      "dad is trusting me to keep you safe, and we need to respect his rules, at least\n",
      "sometimes. Because now we’ve broken his trust too. Does that make sense to\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "There’s a part of me that wants to jump in and protect Luke. But the fact\n",
      "of the matter is, Willa is right. She’s talking to him respectfully, like an adult,\n",
      "and I can’t fault her.\n",
      "I’m also just so relieved to have support, even if it comes in the form of Willa Grant. The redheaded mouthpiece who makes eating green beans look\n",
      "pornographic.\n",
      "Because my dad just acts like Luke is hilarious all the time—which is\n",
      "fine. In fact, that’s why I don’t want him to be Luke’s full-time caretaker. I\n",
      "don’t want to ruin their friendship. I also don’t want Luke to turn into\n",
      "Mowgli. A little wild boy raised by a pack of wild men all living together on\n",
      "a ranch.\n",
      "It’s fucking weird if I think about it too much.\n",
      "“I’m sorry, Dad,” Luke says carefully.\n",
      "“I know you are, buddy.”\n",
      "“I just wanted to have some fun. It sounded so fun! It really was fun!”\n",
      "“We’re ranchers—farmers, Luke. It’s a waste of good food.”\n",
      "“I know,” he replies, defeated. And then he brightens as he glances up at\n",
      "me. “Next time you cover the Jansen’s tractor in toilet paper, can I do it too?”\n",
      "How the fuck does he know about that prank?\n",
      "I see Willa’s lips twitch, but she keeps her focus fixed on her plate. And\n",
      "then she goes for another green bean, and I have to look away.\n",
      "This kid is going to be the death of me.\n",
      "And so is his goddamn nanny.\n",
      "Putting Luke to bed is my favorite part of the night. The cuddles. The stories.\n",
      "The things he tells me in the safety of his dark, peaceful room. He goes all\n",
      "soft and sweet, and we talk about things that don’t come up throughout the\n",
      "day. It’s why I’ll never give up that part of his schedule.\n",
      "My second favorite part of the night? A hot tub to soothe away the aches\n",
      "of the day. A quiet moment in my most frivolous purchase. Time alone to\n",
      "stare up at the stars and enjoy a little solitude.\n",
      "Which is what I’m doing, head tipped back, arms draped over the outer\n",
      "edges, when I hear the back door click shut. My lids pop open, and I see\n",
      "Willa’s silhouette through the rising steam around me.\n",
      "“Shit, sorry. I’ll leave,” she whispers, turning to go, towel wrapped\n",
      "around her tall frame.\n",
      "A smart man would say, \n",
      "Yes, please leave. That’s an excellent idea.\n",
      "I am not a smart man. Instead, I blurt out, “It’s fine.” After all, I told her to make herself at\n",
      "home and use whatever she wanted. Truthfully, I can’t blame a person for\n",
      "wanting to soak out here after chasing a five-year-old all day.\n",
      "“You sure? I thought you were in bed.” It’s hard to hear her because, for\n",
      "once, she sounds a little uncertain. It’s hard to see her too through the heated\n",
      "haze rising off the bubbling water. The shape of her is only highlighted by the\n",
      "glow from within the house, seeping through the sliding glass doors.\n",
      "I should stop using the rising steam as an excuse to stare at her this hard.\n",
      "It’s rude. She’s in her twenties and I don’t want to make her uncomfortable.\n",
      "I tip my head back again and let my eyes flutter shut. “Wouldn’t say it\n",
      "was fine if it wasn’t, Red.”\n",
      "I hear shuffling and a quiet chuckle. “Yeah, you’d tell me to beat it.”\n",
      "Fuck.\n",
      "She’s not trying to be forward. But the words \n",
      "beat it \n",
      "out of her mouth in\n",
      "that slightly hoarse voice has the air around me feeling altogether too thin.\n",
      "Fabric rasps and gentle steps move toward the tub. I squeeze my eyes\n",
      "tighter, refusing to give in to the voice inside my head telling me to peek. To\n",
      "watch her climb over the edge. To see what type of bathing suit she’s wearing\n",
      "and if her skin is as creamy as it looked from that glimpse I could see beyond\n",
      "her shirt yesterday.\n",
      "I ignore the flipping sensation in my stomach.\n",
      "The gentle sound of water sloshing tells me she’s crawling in. Hot water\n",
      "laps at my chest as she settles, and suddenly sharing a hot tub with this\n",
      "woman who I barely know and can’t stop eye-fucking feels entirely\n",
      "inappropriate.\n",
      "Altogether too personal.\n",
      "“Ah,” she hums in pleasure.\n",
      "I give in and glance across at her. Willa’s positioning mirrors mine almost\n",
      "perfectly. Her slender arms drape across the frame, and her face is tipped up\n",
      "to the navy-blue sky. My gaze snags on the exposed column of her throat.\n",
      "The elegant length of it. The way it’s positioned, open for the taking. The\n",
      "way it moves when she swallows.\n",
      "“I’m sorry,” she murmurs without moving her head to address me.\n",
      "“For what?” I rasp back, a little confused as to what she’s talking about.\n",
      "“I already told you it was fine for you to come in.” Even though I’m not so\n",
      "sure that’s true.\n",
      "Tiny, flimsy straps lay across her collarbones and wrap around her shoulders. So easily ripped away.\n",
      "“For doing the hillbilly lettuce thing.” She shakes her head, and another\n",
      "melodic laugh bubbles out of her, like she just can’t quite believe it. “I can’t\n",
      "believe I got duped by a five-year-old.”\n",
      "My lips almost tug up at that. \n",
      "Hillbilly lettuce. \n",
      "“Well, you’ve worked with\n",
      "kids. I’m sure you know how to handle it.” I’m mentally patting myself on\n",
      "the back for complimenting her—sort of—when she drops a bomb I didn’t\n",
      "see coming.\n",

      "up tall. “Pardon me?”\n",

      "and her eyes narrow as she sits up too, the water droplets trailing down over\n",
      "her full chest, right into the valley between her breasts. I grind my teeth at\n",
      "letting my eyes follow and snap them back up to hers when she replies with,\n",
      "“Watch your step, Eaton.”\n",
      "Swallowing, I stare at her from the opposite side of the tub, facing off.\n",
      "“Summer told me you had worked with children. She said you have, and I\n",
      "quote, ‘lots of experience working with rowdy boys.’”\n",
      "I watch Willa’s expression transform from irritated to incredulous. “She\n",
      "didn’t.”\n",
      "“She did.”\n",
      "“Did she elaborate?” Willa scrubs a wet hand over her face and slides it\n",
      "up to the top of her hair, before hitting the twisted knot of her fiery strands.\n",
      "“Did you ask any further questions? God. I should have given you a resume\n",
      "or something. This is so awkward, even by my standards. And it takes a lot to\n",
      "make me uncomfortable.”\n",
      "“So, you have how much experience working with kids?”\n",
      "She barks out her surprise, strawberry lips parting in the most tempting\n",
      "way. “None. Zero. Zilch. I’m a bartender.”\n",
      "My fingers clench into fists beneath the water. “A bartender?”\n",
      "“Yeah. I guess I do have lots of experience with rowdy boys, but not, ya\n",
      "know, children. Adult boys?”\n",
      "“Summer is dead.”\n",
      "Her lips press together and wiggle under the strain of holding back.\n",
      "Laughter erupts from her in the most enthralling way. I shouldn’t be charmed\n",
      "but she’s so genuinely amused. It’s hard to not be at least a little captivated. Her head tilts back and the notes of her laugh drift into the surrounding\n",
      "night.\n",

      "funny. Just not \n",
      "haha \n",
      "funny.\n",
      "“Looks like we both got tricked.” Her chuckles slow, and the dim light\n",
      "illuminates the fullness of her breasts, shimmering with dampness.\n",
      "Scrubbing at my face with my hands, I groan. “Summer was so sick of\n",
      "me being picky that she tricked me into hiring a bartender.”\n",
      "“Listen, if you want a resume or a criminal record check, I won’t\n",
      "complain. But I still think I can do this. I still think Luke and I can have fun\n",
      "this summer. I grew up with great parents, so I must have learned something\n",
      "from them.”\n",
      "“Oh yeah?” I say from behind my hands, partly to hide my frustration and\n",
      "partly to give myself a break from how fucking stunning she looks sitting\n",
      "across from me in my hot tub. “What do your parents do? Do you come from\n",

      "better.”\n",

      "But it flustered me all the same. Sent gooseflesh out over my arms all the\n",

      "I finish chewing and return Harvey’s smile, but it’s Cade’s dark eyes I\n",
      "feel on me from beside his dad. The similarities between them are insane. It’s\n",
      "like I can see how Cade will look in twenty some-odd years.\n",
      "Which is to say, \n",
      "good.\n",
      "“It’s been great. Luke and I have had a lot of fun. Haven’t we, Luke?” I\n",
      "tilt my head to gaze down at him. He insisted on sitting beside me, even\n",
      "though he hasn’t seen his dad since last night. We came up to the main house\n",
      "early and Cade met us here. The little boy beams up at me. “Sure did.”\n",
      "Cade scowls. It’s what he did when Luke moved across the table, away\n",
      "from him.\n",
      "“The most fun!”\n",
      "Harvey’s kind eyes turn back toward his grandson. “What have you been\n",
      "doing?”\n",
      "Luke peers around the table, grinning at everyone. He’s the kind of kid\n",
      "who flourishes under attention rather than crumbles under it. And everyone is\n",
      "here. Both of Cade’s brothers, Rhett and Beau. Summer, of course. Even the\n",

      "apparently, he grew up here on the ranch.\n",
      "I’m just snoopy enough to wish I knew more about his story. Where his\n",
      "parents are and how he got to where he is. The fact he hasn’t said a damn\n",
      "word throughout dinner has me even more curious. He smiles at people from\n",
      "behind the brim of his team cap. Little smirks and winks. He seems nice\n",
      "enough. He seems like he requires more investigation.\n",
      "Beau, on the other hand, has barely stopped talking. Except for now.\n",
      "When Luke talks, everyone listens.\n",
      "“We threw lettuce out the window while driving really fast down the back\n",
      "road!” For a kid who seemed suitably chastised a few days ago, he sure is\n",
      "hamming it up now.\n",
      "“Goddamn. That sounds like fun.” Beau shakes his head and spears some\n",
      "lettuce, a look of nostalgia touching every feature.\n",
      "My eyes snap to Cade’s, who is scowling at his brother. I absently\n",
      "wonder which scowl that is. Irritated? Scolding?\n",
      "Through the salad in his mouth, Beau adds, “I’m gonna do that with you\n",
      "when I get back from this deployment, Lukey. We’ll do watermelons\n",
      "instead.”\n",
      "“Yes!” Luke shoots up in his seat, like he’s forgotten the conversation we\n",
      "had earlier this week.\n",
      "“You sure as shit are not.” Cade pushes the salad around his plate even\n",
      "harder. Hard enough that the tines of his fork screech across his plate. This\n",

      "My mom would say he needs some good sex.\n",
      "I’m not so sure she’d be wrong.\n",

      "pipe up to defuse the conversation. “That not everyone is as fortunate as he is. We dug out a garden and today we planted our lettuce seeds, didn’t we?”\n",
      "He nods enthusiastically at me, and I’m relieved I wasn’t a total buzzkill.\n",
      "Five isn’t too young to hear some truths about the world, but I’m wondering\n",
      "if I overstepped.\n",
      "When I peek over at Cade, though, his scowl is less irritated. Possibly an\n",
      "appreciative scowl?\n",
      "I mean, fuck my life. How did I get to the point where I’m analyzing the\n",
      "way a man scowls at me?\n",
      "Beau chuckles. “Well, you know. Boys will be b—”\n",
      "“No,” I cut him off. Because that saying is straight trash, and years of\n",
      "bartending have given me plenty of time to see boys being boys. Which\n",
      "really is just boys being shitheads. “Boys will be gentlemen.” I point my fork\n",
      "at the big army Ken doll sitting across from me.\n",
      "It’s then that I hear a huff of air in the otherwise dead silent dining room,\n",

      "a fork or something—but the corner of his mouth slants upward. The angle of\n",
      "his face and the darkness of his beard make it hard to see, so I squint a tad,\n",
      "jutting my chin at him to get a closer look. I’m not sure I can call it a smile.\n",
      "An amused scowl?\n",
      "The hockey player clears his throat, not hiding his amusement at all.\n",
      "“Well, Harvey, what have you been up to this week?”\n",

      "for asking, son . . .”\n",
      "I find myself glancing between him and Cade, wondering how Cade\n",
      "might look with a mustache. A joke about free mustache rides pops into my\n",
      "head, and I blink rapidly to clear it.\n",

      "Then I feel it. The scowl. My eyes shift, and Cade is staring right at me,\n",
      "bulging arms crossed over his impossibly broad chest. Biceps straining\n",
      "against his signature black T-shirt. And my cheeks heat for no good reason\n",
      "other than my body is a traitor and I’m probably ovulating. I stare back at him across the table, refusing to look guilty. Trying to\n",

      "to cover it.\n",
      "Rhett chokes on a piece of his food, and Summer slaps his back and coos\n",

      "pushing away from the table and heading toward the front of the house. I\n",
      "can’t make out his facial expression. Not even a little bit. Is he sick? Is he\n",

      "cottage-type vibe, the main house almost feels like some sort of hunting\n",

      "hardware, and dark green walls. I peek down a hallway and see nothing, so I\n",
      "continue toward the front door, seeing that it’s propped open.\n",
      "There’s a long, wide deck with raw log banisters that face out over the\n",
      "long driveway and a full copse of poplars.\n",

      "his back bunched beneath soft cotton. His close-cut black hair is slicked back\n",
      "neatly, and his trimmed beard gives the impression he made an effort tonight.\n",
      "I’ve grown accustomed to seeing him waltz in after a hard day’s work\n",
      "looking all dirty and sweaty and, well, fucking hot, to be honest.\n",
      "I stand for a moment and watch him, trying to decide which look I prefer.\n",
      "His wide palms are propped on the railing and his chin is tucked into his\n",
      "chest.\n",
      "As I approach, his scent sneaks up on me. Crushed pine needles and\n",
      "sunshine. I don’t know how else to explain it. It’s that warm earth that I\n",
      "associate with digging in the garden on a sunny day. There’s nothing\n",
      "manufactured or store-bought about his scent—it’s pure outdoor masculinity.\n",
      "But it’s the shaking of his shoulders that draws my gaze now.\n",
      "He’s crying or laughing, and to be honest, both seem equally unlikely\n",
      "from what I know of this man.\n",
      "“Wanted to come see what a well-blown yard looks like, huh?” I ask.\n",
      "“Willa—” He can barely get my name out. It’s a breath. It’s a wheeze.\n",

      "drops lower and his shoulders shake harder. “I wonder if he’s sore. He really\n",
      "put his back into it.” I snort as I say it. Honestly, I’m barely holding it\n",
      "together. I am a child.\n",
      "Cade gasps and stands up straight, turning his attention to me. There are\n",
      "tears in his eyes, and I’m sure he’s smiling—he has to be—but he has a fist\n",
      "held up over his mouth.\n",
      "He seems younger when he’s laughing. Lighter somehow. It makes me\n",
      "laugh too, and before I know it, we’re both standing there, regarding the\n",

      "town before Chestnut Springs started growing with city folk moving out this way to live the country lifestyle or some cheesy shit like that.\n",
      "And I’m pretty sure Honky Tonk Sundays are designed just for them. It’s\n",

      "I thought she’d take off with Summer. The two of them had a serious case\n",

      "where everyone sits. As always Jasper takes the back corner seat facing away\n",
      "from the rest of the room and Beau takes up position across from him—\n",
      "always facing the room. Willa doesn’t even glance at me when she murmurs, “You don’t come\n",

      "“Not here,” I bite out.\n",
      "She peeks at me from behind a silky curtain of her copper locks. “Yeah,\n",
      "no. That would be rude.”\n",
      "I opt to glare back at her. Because my wish for a flaccid dick is not being\n",

      "table. She moves effortlessly, with an inherent grace. There’s something kind\n",
      "of . . . magical about her. Her laugh, her voice, the fluidity of her movements.\n",
      "It’s not sexual, it’s just an appeal I can’t quite put my finger on.\n",
      "An appeal I’m now going to be stuck sitting beside all night. And living\n",
      "with all summer. I absently wonder if putting up with one of the other\n",
      "applicants who didn’t catch my eye at all would have been preferable, even if\n",
      "it meant putting up with their overt advances for a couple of months.\n",
      "Our server, Bailey, swings by once we’re seated. The girl works her ass\n",
      "off here and at the hospital as a porter. It’s like every ounce of focus and\n",
      "drive that could be shared by her family was all just packed into her. The\n",
      "Jansens own the farm next to us, and she’s the youngest of them. The best of\n",
      "them. The only one without a criminal record, most likely.\n",
      "“I’ll have a Guinness,” Willa says, surprising me by ordering a thick, dark\n",
      "beer. And maybe I’m a dick for expecting something else. I had her pegged\n",
      "as a prissy city girl who’d order some frilly \n",
      "Sex and the City\n",

      "“I’ll have what she’s having.” I hike a thumb at Willa and give Bailey a\n",

      "Willa elbows me, before leaning close and whispering in my ear. “She\n",
      "gets smiles. You should go for it. She’s cute.”\n",
      "I glance at Bailey’s retreating form and shake my head. “Nah. No way.\n",
      "Bailey’s way too young. I just like her.”\n",
      "Willa’s eye twitches, her lips flattening as she looks around the bar. She\n",
      "seems like she’s all bravado and bluster, but I get the sense I just hurt her\n",
      "feelings. Not so much by what I said, but by what I didn’t say.\n",
      "I bump my elbow back at her. “I like you too, Red. I just feel bad for\n",
      "Bailey. Her family is shit but she’s a sweet girl. She gets a bad rap around\n",
      "town.” She rolls her eyes while staring out across the room. “You don’t like me.\n",
      "You tolerate me.”\n",
      "I mull that over. Is that how I come off to her? I guess she has no way of\n",
      "knowing it’s a struggle for me to keep my eyes off her when she interacts\n",
      "with Luke, even harder to keep her image from popping up in my mind when\n",
      "I fist my cock in the shower. Both things I don’t intend to tell her, so I opt\n",
      "for, “The way I see it, I like you a little more every day.”\n",
      "Because that much is true. The girl is growing on me, like a vine\n",
      "wrapping up around an old oak. And for once, I’m not sure I mind.\n",
      "Willa’s head turns slowly, with intent, and her eyes scour my face. I feel\n",
      "like I’m being analyzed, decoded—it’s fucking unnerving.\n",
      "“You trying to put a spell on me, Red? Some sort of city-girl voodoo\n",
      "shit?”\n",
      "“City girl voodoo shit?” She smiles, still staring at me hard. Amused.\n",
      "Glowing. She’s goddamn breathtaking. The rest of the bar fades away, and\n",
      "with a little shake of my head, I give her a reluctant smile and drop her gaze.\n",
      "She laughs and flops back against the couch, watching Bailey approach\n",
      "with a tray full of drinks. “Daddy Cade, you’re a whole lot prettier when you\n",
      "smile.”\n",
      "I can’t help but snort. “You’re insane.” Usually a woman’s attention\n",
      "makes me squirm. It’s too intense. There’s too much pressure. But with Red,\n",
      "she toes the line of joking. Truthfully, I can’t make heads or tails of her. If\n",
      "nothing else, she has my attention.\n",
      "She grins up at me, gently tugging at her long, straight hair. Like that’s an\n",
      "answer.\n",
      "I’d like to tug on that hair too, \n",
      "is what I’m thinking when I feel a hand\n",
      "clamp down on my shoulder. “Cade, buddy, how are ya?”\n",
      "The smile comes easily now. My high school friend, Lance Henderson, is\n",
      "towering over me, grinning like the fucking loon he is.\n",
      "I stand, reaching out to shake his hand in a firm clap while slapping at his\n",
      "shoulder. It’s our kind of equivalent of a hug. “I’m doin’ alright. How about\n",
      "you? What brings you out this way?”\n",
      "“Rodeo nearby. Thought I’d take a detour through the old stomping\n",
      "grounds.”\n",
      "“Yeah?”\n",
      "“Heck yeah.” He nods at the table. “Look at you all. The entire Eaton\n",
      "clan. What is this? Some sort of family reunion?” “Nah, that’s next month.”\n",
      "His eyes drop, and I catch him eyeing up Willa, who is pretending to pay\n",
      "attention to everyone else in the loud bar, but I can tell by the angle of her\n",
      "head that she’s eavesdropping. Snoopy little thing.\n",
      "When I glance back at Lance, it’s almost impossible to miss the\n",
      "appreciative way he’s looking at her.\n",
      "And it fucking bugs me.\n",
      "I take a step over, blocking Willa with my body. “This isn’t the grocery\n",
      "store, Henderson. Whatchya looking for?”\n",
      "His head tips back and he barks out a laugh. “That your girl, Eaton?”\n",
      "I scowl back at him. “No. She’s my nanny.”\n",
      "He arches a brow at me from beneath his tan cowboy hat. “\n",
      "Your \n",
      "nanny?”\n",
      "I sigh like I’m exasperated with him, but no chance am I backing down\n",
      "on this. “You heard me, dickhead. How long you in town for?”\n",
      "His eyes are twinkling, but he doesn’t push the Willa thing any farther,\n",
      "and I drop my shoulders, tension easing out.\n",
      "Pathetic.\n",
      "“Just one night. Was actually hoping to get in touch with you. Couldn’t\n",
      "find ya on social media.”\n",
      "“Why would I need social media?” I deadpan.\n",
      "“I don’t know. To stay in touch with friends like me?”\n",
      "“Once every five or so years in person is perfect for me. Too much of a\n",
      "good thing and all that.” I like Lance but me sharing photos with him and\n",
      "hearting his status updates—never.\n",
      "“I need a partner. My guy is out with a broken collarbone. We’re close to\n",
      "qualifying for the national finals.”\n",
      "“No.”\n",
      "“Why not? You’re one of the best penners I’ve ever seen. It’s a shame\n",
      "you never continued.”\n",
      "People don’t get it. Traveling around rodeoing was never an option for\n",
      "me. No one ever asked me if that’s what I’d \n",
      "like \n",
      "to do. Because I would have\n",
      "loved to do it. I am a good fucking cowboy. But duty called, and that duty\n",
      "was here at home. The ranch. Luke. Family.\n",
      "I was never granted the privilege of doing whatever I wanted, and being\n",
      "reminded of it smarts.\n",
      "“I rope and pen all the time. For work. Not show.”\n",
      "“Good, then you’re not out of practice.” “Lance, it ain’t gonna happen.” I cross my arms over my chest, hearing\n",
      "the buzz of conversation behind me, but I can feel Willa shift closer toward\n",
      "the midline of the couch.\n",
      "“Why not?”\n",
      "“Because I’ve got the ranch. I’ve got a kid. I can’t just take off for days at\n",
      "a time. I can’t hang at your place and practice. I have responsibilities.”\n",
      "“What about the nanny? We can wing it without practice, or I can trailer\n",
      "in.” His eyes drop, and my chest puffs as I shift to block his gaze.\n",
      "“She gets the weekends off.”\n",
      "“We can figure someth—”\n",
      "“I don’t mind working a couple of weekends.” Willa’s body presses\n",
      "beside mine as my head snaps in her direction.\n",
      "“No,” I grit out.\n",
      "She shrugs. “Calm your tits, Eaton. I’m just offering.”\n",
      "Lance laughs and smiles at her, all cowboy charm. It’s fucking annoying.\n",
      "It’s even worse watching him shake Willa’s hand. Her smiling back at him.\n",
      "They’re both sunny and happy. They suit each other well and I hate it bugs\n",
      "me.\n",
      "“Lance Henderson.”\n",
      "“Willa Grant. Pleasure to meet you.”\n",
      "His smile transforms into a smirk I recognize well from watching him\n",

      "all mine.”\n",
      "I like Lance. He’s a good guy, and he’s charming as all get out, but I\n",
      "don’t like him charming my nanny.\n",
      "Which is why I say something I never thought I’d hear myself say. “Willa\n",
      "and I were just about to dance. But it’s been nice seeing you, Lance.” I give\n",
      "him a tip of my chin and grab Willa by the elbow before dragging her out\n",
      "onto the dance floor.\n",
      "“I think I missed the part where we were \n",
      "just \n",
      "about to dance?” she teases\n",
      "as I pull her into a two-step position, trying to just plant my hand at her waist\n",
      "rather than sliding it over her ribs the way I want to.\n",
      "“It was an excuse to get away from that smiley motherfucker.”\n",
      "She casually drapes a hand over my shoulder as my fingers wrap around\n",
      "her dainty hand and we easily fall into step to the upbeat, twangy song. I\n",
      "make a point of staring over her shoulder rather than at her.\n",
      "It’s \n",
      "hard\n",
      ". She’s got some pretty pink dress on. It’s simple, but it hugs her curves,\n",
      "skims her knees, and is altogether too low cut. The way she’s paired it with a\n",
      "pair of white Chuck Taylors makes her look too fucking young.\n",
      "Where Summer is all pencil skirts and high heels, Willa is bright colors\n",
      "and sneakers.\n",

      "“Good lord, woman. Just stop.” I turn my chin down at her and try to give\n",
      "her my most intimidating expression. Just hearing her say the words \n",
      "blow job\n",
      "is too much for a guy who hasn’t gotten one in years.\n",
      "But, as usual, Willa isn’t the least bit deterred.\n",
      "Her fingers pulse in mine, and she does that light, sparkly laugh that\n",
      "makes my dick twitch. “No, wait. You’re going to love this one. It’s so you.”\n",
      "She leans into my ear, and her breath fans across my neck as she huffs out\n",
      "a small snort before composing herself enough to finish the joke. I bite the\n",
      "inside of my cheek to contain whatever expression might pop up on my face.\n",
      "“The ten minutes of silence.”\n",
      "I have to look away across the room. I can feel her body shaking,\n",
      "laughing at her own joke.\n",
      "No shame.\n",
      "“I got you. I saw that. Are your cheeks bleeding, Eaton? Does it hurt to\n",
      "hold in your laughter like that? I hear it can give you erectile dysfunction.”\n",
      "“You kiss your mother with that mouth, Red?”\n",
      "She blows a raspberry, highly amused. “Oh yeah. She’d love that joke.”\n",
      "“The joke’s on you though. I wouldn’t last ten minutes and just because\n",
      "you’d be quiet doesn’t mean I would be.”\n",
      "We both go still, and I watch her eyes widen while I beat myself up\n",
      "internally for letting a snippet of my old self tumble out, woken up by the\n",
      "beautiful redhead in my arms. “Who said anything about me and you, Cade?” She blinks, her thick\n",
      "lashes making her appear a lot more innocent than I’m thinking she is.\n",
      "Young? Yes.\n",
      "Shy? No.\n",
      "It’s a dangerous combination for a man like me.\n",
      "The song changes, and before I can reply, some guy who works at the\n",
      "bank cuts in and asks if he can have the next dance.\n",
      "I nod and step away graciously, even though it kills me. The thought of\n",
      "letting someone else dance with her makes me see red, but I also need to get\n",
      "the fuck away from wherever that conversation was heading. 10 I\n",
      "Cade\n",

      "Willa dance with four different men is four men too many.\n",
      "Ten minutes too long.\n",
      "She’s all smiles and swagger. I watched her lips move almost the entire\n",
      "time. The bottom one is a little fuller than the top. If she wasn’t smiling all\n",
      "the time, it would give her a pouty sort of look. But there is nothing pouty\n",
      "about Willa Grant.\n",
      "She’s a spark in the dark. Dancing flames against a midnight sky. She shines brighter than almost anyone in this entire place with her glossy hair,\n",
      "bright dress, and twinkling green eyes.\n",
      "And she’s the fucking nanny, which means I shouldn’t be counting songs\n",
      "and minutes like some sort of possessive psycho, when all I’ve been to her\n",
      "for over a week is a grumpy asshole.\n",

      "sticking to her glossed bottom lip.\n",
      "Summer says something to her, but it’s hard to hear over the blaring\n",
      "music and constant chatter. Her laughter draws my gaze right as she plunks\n",
      "down beside me without sparing me a glance.\n",
      "She sits closer this time though. Teasing that center line of the couch. I’m\n",
      "reminded of that night I followed her to her room and stared down at the line\n",
      "on the floor.\n",
      "Lines I shouldn’t cross. Lines I shouldn’t even be spending this long\n",
      "staring at.\n",
      "She reaches forward for her beer, and as she does, she places a palm on\n",
      "my thigh to catch her balance, and all those lines blur in my mind. Because\n",
      "all I can see is how petite her hand is on my leg. And all I can feel is the roil\n",
      "of heat seeping into my muscles. The slow swell in my pants.\n",
      "Suddenly I’m not measuring time. I’m measuring inches, because her\n",
      "hand is mere inches away from feeling just how much I don’t dislike her. Not\n",

      "With a sigh, she leans back, appraising the bar before her, and announces,\n",
      "“This place is fun.”\n",
      "I clear my throat, grasping for something to talk about. “Is this like the\n",

      "it. It’s incredible. “No. Not at all. I actually manage my brother’s business.\n",
      "It’s this old theater that he turned into a live music venue downtown. Cleared\n",
      "out the seats. Spring loaded the dance floor. And we book in all sorts of\n",
      "awesome bands. If there’s no show, it’s just a regular bar—a quiet night for the regulars.”\n",
      "I can one hundred percent see Willa in a setting like that. “And why\n",
      "aren’t you working there now?”\n",
      "She rolls her eyes. “Brother blew up. He started a record label and picked\n",

      "Truthfully, I was lonely in the city. It’s nice to be around people—your\n",

      "It’s fascinating to me, listening to someone so uninhibited talk. Someone\n",
      "who says what’s on her mind without concern, who laughs so freely.\n",

      "too?\n",

      "back.\n",
      "And then he goes again.\n",
      "I think that’s \n",
      "his \n",
      "addiction.\n",

      "we all live parallel lives now that my brother and I are adults, whereas you\n",
      "guys are all up in each other’s business. It’s charming. I can see why Summer\n",

      "He’s slipped into the past. Eyes and head somewhere else entirely.\n",
      "Sometimes he still looks like the devastated little boy we took in. I wonder if\n",
      "he relives that day as often as I relive our mother’s death?\n",
      "My head steers in Luke’s direction, and I wonder what he’s doing. If he’s\n",
      "happy. If he’s warm. I know he’s with my dad, but the anxiety around\n",
      "keeping him safe is real for me. I often ponder whether he worries I’ll\n",
      "abandon him like his mom did. I worry I’ll leave him the way our mom left us. Suddenly. Tragically.\n",
      "Now I don’t feel like being out at all. I want to be home, with him tucked\n",
      "in safely in the room next to me or—as still often happens on weekends—in\n",

      "I’m worried she’ll bring up what I said to her on the dance floor. I’m\n",
      "worried she’ll ask me about us again. I’m worried my attraction to her is\n",

      "riding my horse. Or being on the road with my parents. Or learning to\n",

      "enough to that. Because all I can remember thinking is that it was incredible.\n",

      "Maybe I have a crush on an older man.\n",
      "Again.\n",

      "“Please. Sit down.”\n",
      "I glance up to see where the bite in his voice came from, but his eyes are\n",
      "trained on my chest. On the unpadded one-piece swimsuit I’m wearing.\n",
      "On the way my nipple piercings press against the fabric.\n",
      "With a small squeal, I fall back into the water and sink down. It’s not like\n",

      "Top tier.”\n",

      "dipped just slightly as he glares at me from beneath his lashes.\n",
      "This scowl has him looking like a predator.\n",
      "Not a grumpy rancher.\n",

      "The sweet burn of it warms my throat, and I lean into that, trying to let it\n",

      "of it more sensual than I anticipated. The weight of the water pressing on all\n",
      "the best places.\n",
      "I’ve never reacted this way to a man simply looking at me. Years in a bar\n",
      "with men giving me covetous looks, and none had me fumbling around like a nervous virgin.\n",
      "I should hate him for it. But I’m intrigued. “Want to play a game?” I ask,\n",

      "“Where are my panties?”\n",
      "His lips slope up, a sly expression hitting his face. “In the garbage.”\n",
      "I giggle, tipping my head up to stare at the stars overhead. “Good. Your\n",
      "turn to ask.”\n",
      "A deep rumble hums in his chest, and my eyes drop to the definition in\n",
      "his pecs. “Truth or dare?”\n",
      "“Truth.” No way am I picking dare. He’ll dare me not to talk for a week\n",
      "or something.\n",
      "“Why did you have underwear in your purse?”\n",

      "around the glass to make sure he doesn’t drop it. “You just never know,” I\n",

      "It will make sharing the drink easier.\n",
      "That’s what I tell myself.\n",

      "Everyone wears underwear.”\n",
      "I laugh. “Well, that’s true. I guess it shouldn’t matter.” I hold up an\n",

      "A line between employee and employer. A line between an older man and a younger woman. A line that may well differentiate appropriate from\n",
      "inappropriate.\n",
      "“No.” He grabs the glass and pushes himself across to the opposite side of\n",
      "the square, leaning back to feast on my body. I chance a look down at myself\n",
      "now, seeing the outline of my nipples battling against the fabric and the thin\n",

      "A little part of me wants to hide in the water, but the bigger part of me\n",
      "gets off on sitting here on display for him. Knowing he likes what he sees but\n",

      "wanted \n",

      "Knowing his cock has got to be rock-hard under the water.\n",
      "“Truth or dare,” he bites out.\n",

      "right now?”\n",
      "“That I like sitting here with your eyes on me.”\n",

      "“I didn’t pick truth, Willa.”\n",
      "I bite my lip, regarding him. Wondering if I’m going way too far right\n",

      "“Truth or dare?” My voice is full of undisguised desire. I’ve used this\n",
      "voice before to get what I want. It’s worked for me with other men. But never\n",
      "has it resulted in the expression of distressed pleading on Cade’s face when\n",
      "he glances up at me and says, “Dare.”\n",
      "His expression doesn’t say crawl onto my lap and ride me. It says \n",

      "And so that’s what I do. But probably not in the way he saw coming.\n",
      "“I dare you to do those rodeos and let me take care of Luke while you\n",
      "do.”\n",
      "The look he gives me back is dark and fathomless. It’s confused and\n",
      "thankful all at once. Disappointed and relieved in the same beat. When I hear his low, “Okay,” I smile softly at him and swing my legs out\n",
      "of the water onto the deck, not oblivious to the way he’s blatantly watching\n",
      "my every move now. I feel momentarily self-conscious, like he might see\n",
      "something he doesn’t like.\n",
      "But I shake the thought away. The lighting is dim, and it doesn’t matter if\n",
      "he sees the dimples on my ass anyway.\n",
      "Away from the steam of the hot water and the buzz of the bourbon, things\n",
      "look a whole lot clearer. And what Cade Eaton thinks of my body is of little\n",
      "importance.\n",
      "I wrap a towel around myself, turning only when I hit the back door.\n",
      "“Good night, Cade.” He drops his head back and stares at the blanket of stars.\n",

      "Thanks to Willa fucking Grant.\n",

      "between those pretty thighs?\n",
      "Thinking of me?\n",
      "And I refused to relieve myself. I wrapped my palm around my thick\n",

      "blowing my load while thinking of the twenty-something nanny sleeping on\n",
      "the other side of the wall just felt fucking gross. Daring her to sit on the edge of the hot tub, when we both knew why, was bad enough.\n",
      "God.\n",
      " What was I thinking?\n",
      "I lean back against the kitchen counter and swipe my hand over my\n",

      "It’s like I didn’t break enough rules when I was younger—I was too busy\n",
      "being serious—and now that streak is cropping up on me.\n",
      "It’s perfectly natural. Willa is a smoke show. She’d make a priest\n",
      "crumble. And I’m no man of the cloth.\n",
      "“Good morning.” She waltzes into the kitchen like I summoned her just\n",
      "by thinking of her. All wild copper hair piled on top of her head and fresh-\n",
      "faced, which is making her look awfully young.\n",
      "But when my eyes drop to her chest, all warning thoughts of her being too\n",
      "young grow wings and fly right the fuck out of my head. Her perky tits are\n",
      "teasing me through a soft, white cotton concert tee.\n",
      "I couldn’t tell you which band it’s for, because all I can see is outlines of\n",
      "those goddamn nipple piercings.\n",
      "Taunting me. Reminding me how that pretty, pale purple swimsuit\n",
      "wedged itself between her pussy lips.\n",
      "Jealousy of a bathing suit is a new feeling for me.\n",
      "“Good morning,” I bite out, madder at myself than her. But I lash out all\n",

      "Her laugh is airy as she rises on her tippy-toes to reach the top of the\n",

      "calves flex, toned legs disappearing into a pair of baby blue short-shorts, her\n",
      "bare feet on my floor. There’s something intimate about having Willa in my\n",
      "space like this. And Luke isn’t even here to make a good reason for it.\n",
      "“Here, I’ll grab that.” It only takes me one step to stand directly behind\n",
      "her and reach into the back of the cupboard. I guess I don’t normally go\n",
      "through mugs this quickly when I’m the only one using them.\n",
      "“Thanks,” she breathes, shrinking back down onto the soles of her feet,\n",
      "brushing the curve of her ass along my front as she does.\n",
      "I step away quickly, placing the mug on the marble countertop and\n",
      "willing my cock to not pop up and make a special appearance, outing me as\n",
      "the world’s biggest creep.\n",
      "As she pours herself a coffee, she says, “Not at all averse to bras.” Her\n",
      "lips tip up. “But I don’t normally sleep in them. Just grabbing coffee.”\n",
      "She leans against the countertop, all smug with herself. “Do you normally walk around like that when Luke is here?”\n",
      "Her hands wrap around the mug, and she takes a tentative sip, eyeing me\n",
      "over the rim as she does. “No. I normally wait until I hear you leave. Then I\n",
      "get up and make my cup of coffee.”\n",
      "I grunt, feeling like a dick for policing how she walks around. Luke\n",
      "wouldn’t even notice. I’m the fucker with his head in the gutter who can’t\n",
      "handle it.\n",
      "“Then I go back to my room and put my panties on,” she huffs out\n",
      "quietly, peering up playfully from behind her mug.\n",
      "“Wait. Did you just say that you wait for me to leave and then make\n",
      "coffee?”\n",
      "Her brow arches. “Smarter than you look, Eaton.”\n",
      "“But I’m up at 4:30.”\n",
      "She shrugs. “Yeah. It’s kind of nice. I sit on the front deck and read my\n",
      "dirty books. It’s peaceful. I like the morning, and since I’m not out until three\n",
      "a.m. working, I can actually enjoy them. I hate sleeping in. I always feel like\n",
      "I’ve wasted my day.”\n",
      "“Why do you wait for me to leave?”\n",
      "She gives me a face that says she thinks I’m an idiot. “Because if you’re\n",
      "this grumpy midmorning, I’d hate to see you first thing. Those cowboys\n",
      "down at the ranch must be terrified of you.”\n",
      "I grunt. They are. And that’s just how I like it.\n",
      "“Do my nipples bother you, Cade?”\n",
      "Coffee sprays from my mouth.\n",
      "I get most of it back in my mug, but not all. My hand is soaked, and I can\n",
      "feel the droplets of it in my beard.\n",
      "Willa blinks at me innocently, and my heartbeat thunders in my ears.\n",
      "Fake innocence. She knew what she was doing when she asked that\n",
      "question.\n",
      "“No.” I wipe at my face, turning to put my coffee back down on the\n",
      "countertop. I need to pick my next words carefully so I don’t come off like a\n",
      "condescending asshole.\n",
      "I know I often come across that way, and I don’t want to with Willa. It’s\n",
      "an unfamiliar feeling, \n",
      "wanting \n",
      "someone to like me. “It’s just that—”\n",
      "“It’s funny. I thought about you telling me panty lines aren’t something\n",
      "we should worry about people seeing, and I’m feeling the same way about\n",
      "my nipples.” I blink at her.\n",
      "Hell. No.\n",
      "“We all have nipples, right?”\n",
      "I swallow, at a loss for how to reason my way out of this. She’s trapped\n",
      "me in a box of my own logic.\n",
      "“For example . . .” Her bright green feline eyes drop to my chest. “I can\n",
      "see yours right now.”\n",
      "My chin snaps toward my chest, and sure enough, my nipples are giving\n",
      "me away.\n",
      "“And they don’t bother me at all.” She licks her bottom lip slowly, with\n",
      "intention, before one cheek hitches up in a lopsided smirk.\n",
      "Then she turns and walks back toward her bedroom, holds one fist up\n",
      "above her head, and says, “Fuck the patriarchy.”\n",
      "And I’m left standing there. Watching her. Wondering if she’s wearing\n",
      "any panties under those soft, loose shorts I could so easily pull to the side.\n",
      "“You can’t put your fingers there, pal. Or you’re going to cut them clean off.”\n",
      "“I know what I’m doing, Dad.” Luke rolls his eyes and continues to chop\n",
      "a cucumber in the stupidest way imaginable.\n",
      "I grab the knife and lift it up. “Listen. You’re going to hold this properly\n",
      "or risk giving me a heart attack. I want you to know how to do this properly.\n",
      "You said you’d listen to my instructions.”\n",
      "The trade-off was that I have to listen to his terrible pop music on the\n",

      "only one year of school.\n",
      "It’s Sunday night, and I’m making a full-blown gourmet meal. Luke is\n",
      "helping me cook because I refuse to raise a man who doesn’t know how to\n",
      "hold his own in a kitchen. Feeding the people I care about is how I tell them I\n",
      "care without having to say it out loud.\n",
      "Because saying it out loud makes it a little too real for me.\n",
      "“Fine,” he huffs out, dramatically shrugging his shoulders.\n",
      "“Your dad’s right.” Willa appears out of thin air, reaching in and swiping\n",
      "a coin of cucumber and popping it into her mouth. “If you cut like that, all\n",
      "you’ll be left with is a thumb, and how will I teach you to play guitar?” “Willa!” Luke turns on the chair he’s standing on and launches himself\n",
      "into her arms. “We missed you!”\n",
      "She laughs, squeezing his ribs and spinning him in a little circle. They’re\n",
      "equally dramatic.\n",
      "“She spent \n",
      "one \n",
      "night in the city, Luke.” I cross my arms, trying to hide\n",
      "how adorable I find it that he likes her so much.\n",
      "Willa winks at me over Luke’s shoulder. “I missed you too, you little\n",
      "psycho. I’m not so sure your dad missed me though.”\n",
      "“Pfft.” Luke’s head rolls as she places him back onto the chair. “He did.\n",
      "He told me so.”\n",
      "Willa looks visibly shocked by that. “Oh, yeah?”\n",
      "“He said the house feels silent without you here.”\n",
      "Her lips twitch as she tries to hold back her laughter. “I think that just\n",
      "means I talk too much or play my music too loud.”\n",
      "“No way.” Luke sighs. “I love talking with you. And playing music with\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "There’s a beauty in children his age saying what they mean. They don’t\n",
      "wonder how it will come off, or if someone might read too much into it. If\n",
      "it’s in their heart, they say it. I know Luke loves talking with Willa, and it\n",
      "makes my chest ache.\n",
      "Especially when she gives him the full, megawatt smile that lights her up\n",
      "head to toe, ruffles his hair, and says, “I love talking with you too, buddy.”\n",

      "us.”\n",
      "I don’t want her thinking I’m downright obsessed with her.\n",
      "I don’t want her knowing I did kind of . . . notice her absence. It’s only\n",
      "been a couple of weeks, but I’ve gone from being annoyed by her presence\n",
      "when I get home from a hard day’s work to smiling as I kick off my boots\n",

      "Music to my fucking ears.\n",

      "Horrified, Luke asks me what's wrong with “Watermelon Sugar”, but\n",

      "kitchen.\n",
      "I try not to stare at her ass in the denim cutoffs she’s wearing.\n",
      "I fail.\n",
      "Then I’m back to the potatoes, skinning them aggressively while trying to\n",
      "monitor Luke’s precious little fingers. He’s focusing so hard that his tongue\n",

      "He looks . . . grown-up. I know he’s not yet, but he’s also not the fully\n",
      "dependant toddler he once was. He doesn’t wake me up multiple times a\n",
      "night. He can get his own cereal out for breakfast.\n",
      "It’s terrifying.\n",
      "The music shuts off, and I turn to the kitchen table where Willa has pulled\n",

      "The shy smile that touches her lips as her head dips down has me\n",
      "softening toward her. She’s so brash sometimes, and then there’s this sweet\n",
      "side. This bashful side. This insecure side.\n",
      "And she has no business feeling that way at all.\n",

      "flexed, the curved arch of her foot somehow sensual. I run into this problem\n",
      "where she’s concerned a lot.\n",
      "The most trivial little details have me obsessing over her.\n",
      "The tune sounds just as good as it did the first time. Sultry and slow. It’s\n",

      "Her lean fingers move across the string seamlessly, stretching and flexing\n",
      "with every note she strums.\n",

      "I’m not ready to be laid bare. Not by her. Not by anyone.\n",
      "Luke’s mom may not have been the right woman for me, but she was \n",
      "a\n",
      "woman for me. And I did my best to keep her happy. I tried to love her. And\n",
      "in my own way, I did. It wasn’t cinematic but I was faithful. I provided for\n",
      "her. I worked myself to the bone to build us a good life.\n",
      "And she left. It wasn’t enough. Even today, I don’t have much more than I did then.\n",

      "her. She lights up when I laugh.\n",
      "She sings about dust on a bottle and how the contents just keep getting\n",
      "better with age. It’s funny, she’s poking fun at me and she knows it. The\n",
      "night flows from there. Conversation, jokes, good food. And after that song\n",

      "She’s fucking enchanting.\n",
      "“Okay?” Her head quirks, and her silky hair tumbles around her\n",

      "I give her a small smile, chuckling at the absurdity of their competition,\n",

      "about dancing. She’s fun. She’s funny. And Luke loves it. He doesn’t even\n",

      "wildly.\n",
      "She does some shaky, twerky move that I’m sure the kids these days have\n",
      "a name for, and eventually grabs his hands in hers to make him dance with\n",

      "crests her perfect lips. When the song ends and the beat of silence slips into a\n",
      "softer, slower melody, I should step away.\n",
      "But I don’t. Instead, I pull her close, not missing the tiny, shocked gasp\n",

      "“Should I stop?” I drop my voice, letting my eyes linger on her lips.\n",
      "Her response comes fast, without hesitation. “No.”\n",

      "“What about it?” Her eyes roll, suddenly shy again.\n",

      "your heart. It’s haunting and beautiful, and I find myself straining to listen.\n",

      "every inch of her. Sinking into her.\n",
      "“The song is ‘Fade into You’ by Mazzy Star. It’s one of my favorites,”\n",

      "“No. Just riding.”\n",

      "friction. My hand splays on her back. “I’ll find you a horse to ride.”\n",
      "“You’re a good man, Cade Eaton. Quite possibly one of the best.” Her\n",

      "ground and shakes his head. “Goddamn fucking asshole!” he exclaims.\n",
      "“Gotta be smarter than the horse, Lee,” Cade calls. “And watch your\n",

      "like I’ve never heard a swear word in my life. Leave it to Cade to make me\n",
      "seem like some fragile princess.\n",
      "I wave in their general direction and offer a friendly smile as I drawl,\n",

      "approving of my jokes. “Bad word, Willa!”\n",

      "fence, waving one dusty hand in my direction.\n",
      "When one domino falls, so do the rest. Within seconds most of the guys\n",
      "are laughing and Cade is shaking his head at me.\n",
      "He does that a lot where I’m concerned.\n",
      "I wink at him. “Thank you for the coffee. I’m ready for you to break my\n",
      "back.”\n",
      "His face pales, like he realizes how I could have interpreted his note. “I\n",
      "meant you could ride if you wanted to.”\n",
      "“Oh, I want to.”\n",
      "Heat flares on his cheeks. I shouldn’t prod the bear like this, but it’s just\n",
      "who I am. I like to watch him squirm.\n",
      "“A horse. You can take mine.” He hikes a thumb over his shoulder.\n",
      "“Nah, I think I’ll take one of the young ones.”\n",
      "“No chance.” His jaw hardens.\n",
      "“Why not?” I quirk a brow.\n",
      "“I don’t want you to get hurt.” He says it so simply, like it should be\n",
      "obvious to me.\n",
      "“But I thought that’s what the note meant? Unless the note really\n",
      "meant . . .” I trail off and waggle my eyebrows at him.\n",

      "and now you’re not?”\n",
      "“I changed my mind. My ranch. My rules. It’s possible you don’t ride all\n",

      "the foul-mouthed cowboy total stink eye.\n",
      "“That one is rank. I’m pulling you something good-natured,” he says,\n",
      "walking away with his horse in hand, Luke following to see the others. Like\n",
      "his choice is final.\n",
      "There must be at least ten horses in that pen, but it’s the sorrel horse in\n",
      "the round pen that has my attention. The one who chucked that cowboy good\n",
      "and hard.\n",
      "I feel kindred with that one, and I didn’t wear my jeans and paddock\n",
      "boots in the middle of summer so I could stand around in the sun, sweating.\n",
      "While Cade’s back is turned, I march in the opposite direction and duck\n",
      "under the fence post of the round pen. I feel eyes on me, but the men say\n",
      "nothing to stop me.\n",
      "They must be smarter than Cade.\n",
      "The little horse’s nostrils flare with each breath, wary eyes looking\n",
      "around a little. But honestly, I’m not worried. I ride well. I know I do. I\n",
      "haven’t been handed easy horses my entire life. I haven’t had grooms and\n",
      "trainers do the dirty work while I sat on the sidelines. I grew up with more\n",
      "money than most of the other girls at my barn, and yet I was always the one\n",
      "that had to work for things.\n",
      "My dad often joked that none of the money was mine. It was his, and he\n",
      "wasn’t going to spoil me with it.\n",
      "Both my parents value a good work ethic. Hard work and making\n",
      "something of yourself are what they value most. They never forced my\n",
      "brother or me into post-secondary educations. They followed our leads, and\n",
      "while I thought it was unfair at a younger age, I get it now. I get not\n",
      "bankrolling your children’s lives. I get not micromanaging their choices.\n",
      "And I’m glad they haven’t. However, I’d have taken a \n",
      "little \n",
      "more\n",
      "pressure.\n",
      "Maybe I wouldn’t be a directionless bartender if they had set more\n",
      "expectations. Who’s to say?\n",
      "With that in mind, I take the reins and slide a hand over the young horse’s\n",
      "shoulder.\n",
      "“Boss is gonna kill ya,” one cowboy mutters from the opposite side of the\n",
      "fence panel. I just smile to myself.\n",
      "No, he’s not. Cade Eaton is out of his depth with me.\n",
      "I push my hand into the stirrup, shifting the saddle across the horse’s\n",
      "back, watching her ears flick back and forth. “Easy, baby,” I murmur.\n",
      "Her head inclines toward me slightly, big round eye assessing me. I\n",
      "decide she likes me. I decide she’s smart.\n",
      "These guys all think they’re tough and can outmuscle a horse, but they’re\n",
      "wrong.\n",
      "I put my foot into the stirrup before pressing down, and she still doesn’t\n",
      "move.\n",
      "“Red, don’t you fucking dare.”\n",
      "I shake my head, but don’t look behind me at Cade. He’s only sort of my\n",
      "boss.\n",
      "He doesn’t feel much like a boss lately. And I’m difficult to boss around\n",
      "at the best of times—ask my dickhead brother.\n",
      "With one deep breath, I swing a leg over the filly’s narrow back, sinking\n",
      "gently into the saddle.\n",
      "“Woman.”\n",
      "I snort. Cade just \n",
      "womaned \n",
      "me. I want to laugh, but I can feel the horse’s\n",
      "back curled up beneath me.\n",
      "She’s standing still—but not for long. She’s coiling all that energy to go\n",
      "straight up, so I open one rein wide, turning her head in toward my leg and\n",
      "give her a firm kick before she can bunch up any further.\n",
      "Instantly, she’s hopping and kicking, but I squeeze my thighs and drop\n",
      "my heels, keeping her in a tight circle so she can’t explode.\n",
      "“What a good baby,” I coo at her, even though she’s tossing herself\n",
      "around like a total fool. But not enough to loosen me off her. I refuse to fail\n",
      "in front of these guys. I especially refuse to fail in front of Cade.\n",
      "He’ll be all annoying and \n",
      "I told you so \n",
      "about it and my ego honestly can’t\n",
      "handle that type of blow where he’s concerned.\n",
      "I urge the filly forward, driving with my seat, to send that momentum\n",
      "ahead of us rather than up in the air. And in under a minute, she’s dropped\n",
      "the shenanigans and is cantering around the round pen.\n",
      "It’s not pretty, but it’s not a bronc show either. I hear the hoots and\n",
      "hollers of the guys around me—the whistles and the “yeehaws”—but I keep\n",
      "her going, letting her tire herself out. Letting her run until she settles and\n",
      "drops her head. It takes my all to not turn to Cade and stick my tongue out at him.\n",
      "You’re twenty-five, you’re twenty-five, you’re twenty-five\n",
      ".\n",
      "He turns me into an idiot. A bold, drooling, showboating idiot. He’s a\n",
      "challenge and look at me—I love a challenge.\n",
      "Eventually the filly breaks to a trot, and then a walk, and I reach forward\n",
      "to run a hand up her sweaty neck.\n",
      "“Not bad, city girl!” One of the guys calls out, and I peek up, grinning in\n",
      "his general direction, before hopping off.\n",
      "“Better than any of you fuckin’ dress-up cowboys managed,” Cade bites\n",
      "out, seething from beneath his cowboy hat.\n",
      "He looks pissed, and the flutter in my stomach at how imposing he is has\n",
      "me wishing he’d take some of that frustration out on me.\n",
      "“I’m gonna ride like Willa when I grow up!” Luke has climbed up to the\n",
      "top panel of the fence and leans over, eyes glowing with excitement. “She\n",
      "made that filly her bitch!”\n",
      "“Luke!” I say right as Cade barks, “Lucas Eaton.”\n",
      "The little boy’s eyes widen as he drops off the fence, like he knows he’s\n",
      "stepped in it now. He takes off into the barn, tiny cowboy boots thumping\n",
      "against the dirt road, without a backward glance.\n",
      "“You taught him that.” Cade points at me as I lead the filly over to one of\n",
      "the guys.\n",
      "“Yeah?” I quirk a brow and head toward the man I started out not liking\n",
      "but who I now can’t stop thinking about.\n",
      "Fantasizing about.\n",
      "From my side of the fence, I lean close, dropping my voice. “I’m pretty\n",
      "sure of the two of us, you’re the one with the filthy mouth, Cade.”\n",
      "His hand shoots between the metal panels, fingers hooking through my\n",
      "belt loop to hold me still. To keep me there, as he breathes down on to me.\n",
      "The whoosh of each exhale caresses my cheek. “You have no fuckin’ idea,\n",
      "Red.”\n",
      "With one little tug on my jeans, he jostles me and then steps away,\n",
      "spinning one hand up above his shoulders and shouting at the guys. “Let’s go\n",
      "assholes. Break time is over. You’ve been shown up by a prissy city girl.\n",
      "Now prove to me I shouldn’t fire your useless asses.”\n",
      "I snort. The man really has a poetic way with words.\n",
      "As I scoot through the fence near the barn where I saw Luke run, one man\n",
      "exclaims toward my retreating form, “God fuckin’ damn. The view out here has never been so good.”\n",
      "My lips quirk, and I turn to give him a wink, but with two easy steps\n",
      "Cade’s arm darts out and shoves him off the top of the fence where he’d been\n",
      "sitting. The cowboy lands on his knees with a loud bark of disbelieving\n",
      "laughter.\n",
      "Cade’s not laughing though. “Eyes on the dirt if you plan to keep your\n",
      "job, cowboy.”\n",
      "I just turn away and smile to myself, because Cade is seething. It’s almost\n",
      "like he’s jealous.\n",
      "And I think I like that. 14 I\n",
      "Cade\n",
      "Willa:\n",
      " Panties? Check. Bra? No check.\n",
      "Cade:\n",
      " You’re going to a children’s birthday party. Try again.\n",
      "Willa:\n",
      " Right. Let me try again.\n",
      "Willa:\n",
      " Panties? No check. Bra? Also no check.\n",
      "Cade:\n",
      " The town is talking about you enough as it is.\n",
      "Willa:\n",
      " Oooh. What are they saying?\n",
      "Cade:\n",
      " That your panty lines are very defined.\n",
      "Willa:\n",
      " My god. Did you just make a joke?\n",
      "Cade:\n",
      " I’ll be there at 6 tonight. Please don’t embarrass me.\n",
      "Willa:\n",
      " Oh boy. Is that a challenge?\n",
      "Cade:\n",
      " Bye, Red.\n",
      "Willa:\n",
      " I do this with Luke when he behaves badly too. Just ignore him. I\n",
      "don’t think it’s going to work on me though.\n",
      "pull up in front of the sizeable newly built house where the birthday party\n",
      "is being hosted. Truthfully, I hate this shit.\n",
      "Showing up at kids’ birthday parties as a single dad in a small town\n",
      "feels like being locked in a cage full of hungry lions.\n",
      "Or is it cougars?\n",
      "I shake my head, stepping out of my truck. Droplets of water rain down\n",
      "the back of my neck, because I rushed out of the shower to get here so Willa\n",
      "wouldn’t be stuck in the cougar den by herself. I’m not oblivious to how snoopy and pushy people in this town can be.\n",
      "Especially around my family, who they’ve always treated a little like royalty.\n",
      "Like ticks who crawl up out of the shrubs to catch a ride.\n",
      "Talia happened once and that will never happen again.\n",
      "I snag a cap from the back seat and fit it to my head before spinning the\n",
      "brim to the back.\n",
      "The happy squeals of children and the sound of splashing water draw me\n",
      "around the side of the house. I reach over the wooden gate and pull on the\n",
      "hidden string.\n",
      "City folks.\n",
      "It’s like they think no one knows this string is there.\n",
      "I step into the heavily landscaped backyard, taking in the in-ground pool\n",
      "and the parents milling around while children run around in their swimsuits.\n",
      "But it’s the sight of Luke crying in soaked clothes while Willa crouches\n",
      "in front of him, rubbing at his arms at the poolside that gets my heart\n",
      "pumping.\n",
      "The kid puts up a good front. He plays it tough. But right now, he’s\n",
      "borderline inconsolable.\n",
      "I can see the tension in Willa’s body, the heartbreak in her eyes. And it\n",
      "makes me like her even more. She doesn’t care about the rest of the party\n",
      "buzzing around her. She’s only got eyes for my son.\n",
      "And when she pulls him in for a hug, soaking herself in the process, I\n",
      "melt.\n",
      "Luke whispers something in her ear and points at another kid. I should\n",
      "recognize these kids and parents, but I usually pawn this shit off on my dad.\n",
      "Forced socialization with adults I don’t like is its own special brand of\n",
      "torture, and I guess there are limits to what I’ll do for my kid.\n",
      "Willa stands and glances over her shoulder at the boy sucking on a\n",
      "lollipop, standing with his back to her. I think he’s the birthday kid, but I’m\n",
      "not entirely sure. His mom, whose name I also forget, is standing with two\n",
      "other moms chatting.\n",
      "A quick glance back at Willa has me walking across the grass, because\n",
      "her expression is pure fire. Rhett told me she was loyal, and I recognize that\n",
      "look on her face. Because when someone shits on a person I care about, I\n",
      "make it too.\n",
      "In just a few strides, Willa is bent over by the birthday boy, who stares up\n",
      "at her and laughs with a little shit-eating grin on his face. “Excuse me!” his mom trills, her white wine spritzer swirling in the glass.\n",
      "Willa isn’t touching the kid, but she’s right in his face, and I can see her\n",
      "lips moving slowly like she’s carefully enunciating her words.\n",
      "“Did you hear me? Stop talking to him!”\n",
      "“Somebody needs to explain right from wrong in terms he can\n",
      "understand,” Willa says over her shoulder to the red-cheeked mom. “Or did\n",
      "you miss the part where he pushed Luke into the pool and held his head under\n",
      "water?”\n",
      "“It was a joke! You’re out of line, and you will not speak another word to\n",
      "him.”\n",
      "Luke’s tear-stained face tells me he wasn’t in on the joke.\n",
      "Willa rises slowly, almost predatory in her movements, as she turns and\n",
      "arches a brow at the woman. “Oh, no?”\n",
      "“Not another word.”\n",
      "“Fine.” Willa smiles but it’s a scary smile. And then, with one well-\n",
      "placed hip check, the birthday boy goes flying into the water.\n",
      "“Sebastian!” His mother’s spritzer sloshes on her hand as she rushes\n",
      "forward.\n",
      "Luke is suitably shocked. The mom’s mouth is moving, but no sound is\n",
      "coming out, just like when you pull a trout from the lake.\n",
      "Willa crouches at the pool’s edge, smirking at the boy, who is already\n",
      "standing in the shallow water, angrily wiping his eyes. “Life lesson, shithead.\n",
      "Careful who you pick a fight with. Someone insane might love them.”\n",
      "“You need to leave! Now!” The mom points toward the gate, and her arm\n",
      "shakes with fury.\n",
      "I’m almost to them, but the sight of Willa knocking a kid into the pool\n",
      "stopped me in my tracks.\n",
      "She really is insane.\n",
      "Possibly in the best way.\n",
      "“Gladly.” She stands, brushing her hands. “Contact a professional if he\n",
      "starts killing bunnies or something.”\n",
      "“Willa,” I bark, back in motion now.\n",
      "“Oh, good,” the mom says. “A \n",
      "real\n",
      " parent is here.”\n",
      "I should know her name for the number of times she’s tried to chat me up\n",
      "at the grocery store or school pick up, but I don’t, so I take a guess at what\n",
      "sounds close and pray I’m right. “Hi, Bunny.”\n",
      "She blinks at me. “It’s Betty.” Should have prayed harder, I guess. “Oh, sorry. My mistake. Slip of the\n",
      "tongue. Is there a problem?”\n",
      "“Yes. Your \n",
      "nanny\n",
      " is the problem.”\n",
      "I don’t appreciate the condescending way she says nanny, so I offer back,\n",
      "“Willa is a friend, actually.”\n",
      "Willa blinks. Betty blinks. Luke walks up and wraps his arms around\n",
      "Willa’s waist, while the shithead kid pulls himself out of the pool, looking\n",
      "suitably chastised.\n",
      "“She pushed my son into the pool.”\n",
      "“I tripped.” Willa smirks, wrapping a protective arm around Luke’s small\n",
      "body.\n",
      "Betty’s blue eyes narrow, and her voice is shrill when she stomps her foot\n",
      "and sort of squeals, “Leave!”\n",
      "“Let’s all be polite here.” I give Betty a pointed look before Willa goes\n",
      "even further.\n",
      "“Of course. Thank you so much for having me, \n",
      "Bunny\n",
      ".” Willa winks\n",
      "before turning to Luke. “I’ll see you back at home, buddy.”\n",
      "Home.\n",
      "She says it so easily. Like it’s true. That our home is her home. She also\n",
      "said she loves Luke, and I don’t know what to make of that.\n",
      "I should be more pissed at someone about something right now, but I’m\n",
      "altogether too busy trying to wrap my head around the firecracker in front of\n",
      "me.\n",
      "“No! I want to go with you.” I watch Luke’s knuckles turn white where\n",
      "he grips at her clothes, practically clinging to her, tears still shimmering on\n",
      "his pudgy little cheeks.\n",
      "I turn, squeezing one hand on Willa’s slender shoulder while running the\n",
      "other over Luke’s hair. I bend down and press a kiss to the crown of his head.\n",
      "When I straighten, Willa’s confident air has melted away. She has a\n",
      "pinched forehead, and her eyes are a little glassy. Her voice is hushed and\n",
      "cracks when she says, “That kid held him under water.” Her blinks turn rapid.\n",
      "“I had to pull him out. And they all just laughed like it was a funny prank.”\n",
      "The papa bear in me roars at the story she’s recounting. My protective\n",
      "side. The one I’ve been honing for decades. I slide my hand up to the side of\n",
      "her neck, rubbing a thumb over the pulse point there, as I hold her bright\n",
      "green gaze with my own. “Go. I’ll meet you back at home. I got this.”\n",
      "Her head tilts ever so slightly into my touch. And then she nods. I watch for a few beats as she departs with Luke leaned into her as if\n",
      "she’s the most comforting thing in the world. I absently wonder how he’ll\n",
      "handle her leaving when school starts back.\n",
      "Poorly, probably.\n",
      "I wonder how I’ll handle her leaving next month.\n",
      "Just as poorly I bet.\n",
      "“That Willa character needs a leash,” the mom sniffs from behind me.\n",
      "My chest puffs up when I turn my attention on the bottle blonde across\n",
      "from me. “Betty, I like to think I’m a gentleman, but I’m only going to tell\n",
      "you once. Keep her name out of your mouth if you’re going to use that tone.\n",
      "Let’s talk about your kid instead.”\n",
      "One manicured hand falls across her chest, and she rears back, like she’s\n",
      "totally scandalized.\n",
      "Joke’s on Betty.\n",
      "I’m just getting started here.\n",
      "Willa might drive me insane. She might deserve a little pushback. But if\n",
      "Betty thinks she’s going to be the one to push back at her, she’s got another\n",
      "thing coming.\n",
      "Willa might be a bit of psycho—after all, she did just push a child into the\n",

      "psycho.\n",

      "under water.\n",
      "I kept my conversation with Betty fairly contained. It’s a small town, and\n",
      "there are only so many bridges you can burn. Everyone will talk about this\n",
      "anyway. Particularly with the way Willa went off.\n",
      "I shake my head at the memory. The way she’d called her \n",
      "Bunny\n",
      " even after Betty corrected me. The girl has a real pair on her—I’ll give her that.\n",
      "Especially after watching her on that filly this morning.\n",
      "The sound of delighted giggles draws my attention out the open kitchen\n",
      "window toward the back hay field where the first cut bales are stacked. When\n",
      "I see a flash of copper hair, I know they must be out there.\n",
      "Playing. \n",
      "Laughing. I let my eyes flutter shut and listen to them.\n",
      "“Ready or not! Here I come!” Luke shouts breathlessly.\n",
      "It’s perfect.\n",
      "I smile to myself and then open my eyes, knowing the only place I want\n",
      "to be right now is out in the field with them—even if I am dead on my feet\n",
      "after working all day and dealing with small-town-mom drama.\n",
      "Within minutes, I’m stepping into the huge maze-like structure made of\n",
      "big round bales, the dark passageways between them almost too narrow for\n",
      "me to pass through.\n",
      "“I can hear you giggling, you little goose.”\n",
      "“A goose?” he shouts.\n",
      "“A silly goose!” she calls, voice back to the light singsong version I first\n",
      "noticed, all traces of the earlier anxiety gone.\n",
      "I run into Luke first as he hunts Willa down with a serious expression on\n",
      "his face. He instantly holds a finger over his mouth, signaling me to be quiet,\n",
      "like he didn’t just totally broadcast his location by calling out to her.\n",
      "Crouching down, I pull him into a quick hug, needing to feel him—the\n",
      "beat of his heart, the little whoosh of his breath, his chubby cheek against my\n",
      "stubbled one.\n",
      "“I love you, buddy,” I rasp out, feeling emotional.\n",
      "“I love you too, Dad.” He pats my back. “But you’re going to make me\n",
      "lose.”\n",
      "I chuckle. I’m sure Willa knows where he is. What he doesn’t know is\n",
      "he’s only going to catch her if she wants him to.\n",
      "It seems crazy that I ever thought she wouldn’t be able to keep him safe,\n",
      "and now she’s done nothing but. Sure, his nannies and babysitters always\n",
      "watched him, but I don’t know if they’d have gone to bat for him the way\n",
      "Willa did today.\n",
      "The way I would have in that same situation.\n",
      "“I’ll go that way, see if we can track her down together. Divide and\n",
      "conquer.”\n",
      "He bobs his head. “Yeah. Yeah. That’s a good plan.” I give his hair a quick muss, pressing one more kiss to his head before he\n",
      "turns and darts away. I know we need to talk about what happened today, but\n",
      "now’s not the moment. I’m sure it will all come out when I lie down with him\n",
      "at bedtime.\n",
      "I turn into the bales, heading in the opposite direction, the dry points of\n",
      "stray pieces scratching at my arms as I move in toward the center of the\n",
      "structure searching for Willa.\n",
      "I hear the dull thump of small feet around me, Luke winding his way up\n",
      "and down the rows. Every sense feels elevated in here, the hay providing a\n",
      "sort of soundproofing, a privacy. The walls of it press in around me. It smells\n",
      "comforting.\n",
      "It smells like nostalgia. I’m taken back to days when Beau and I would\n",
      "chase Rhett and our little sister Violet through here. Same field and\n",
      "everything.\n",
      "To my right, I see a flash. Daylight blocked out for a moment before it\n",
      "shines through again. I turn and follow, knowing I’ve got her now.\n",
      "My strides lengthen as I veer right, catching sight of her creeping along\n",
      "carefully.\n",
      "“Red,” I whisper-shout.\n",
      "Her head flips in my direction, her eyes twinkling. Because, if nothing\n",
      "else, Willa Grant is a shit disturber, waltzing into my life and complicating it\n",
      "without even trying. Looking all pleased with herself over it.\n",
      "With a wink over her shoulder, she shoots off, running from me.\n",
      "And something primal in me roars to life.\n",
      "I chase her.\n",
      "Luke is way over on the other side of the bales, and while I wouldn’t say\n",
      "that I’ve forgotten about him, it’s Willa who has my full attention right now.\n",
      "I jog as best I can in the cramped space, my mind laser-focused. All I see\n",
      "is her, and all I hear is blood pumping in my ears.\n",
      "She veers again, and I hear a small, gasped giggle when she glances over\n",
      "her shoulder and sees that I’ve gained on her.\n",
      "One turn left has her heading in Luke’s direction. And while I told him I\n",
      "was going to help him catch her, the truth is . . . I want her to myself for a\n",
      "moment.\n",
      "I can’t explain it. It’s instinct.\n",
      "My arm extends in front of me, and my fingers wrap around her delicate\n",
      "wrist, clamping down and yanking her back to me before she can cross paths with my kid and put a stop to this dangerous game of cat and mouse we seem\n",
      "to be playing.\n",
      "Air whooshes out of her lungs as she stumbles back into me, shoulder\n",
      "blades thumping against my chest.\n",
      "“Jesus Christ.” She chuckles, not moving away from my body. In fact,\n",
      "she leans into me, glancing over her shoulder. “Relax, daddy. It’s just a kid’s\n",
      "game.”\n",
      "I turn, pulling her back in toward the center of the maze. “Running pretty\n",
      "hard for a woman playing a kid’s game, Red.”\n",
      "She laughs, not taking me seriously—in typical fashion.\n",
      "“And stop calling me that.”\n",
      "“Why?” she asks breathlessly as I turn a corner before pressing my back\n",
      "into the hay, giving her a tug that has her stumbling into my chest.\n",
      "She catches herself by splaying one hand on my pec. We both look down,\n",
      "transfixed by where she’s made contact. My shirt might as well not be there\n",
      "because it feels like she’s touching my bare skin.\n",
      "My cock twitches, clearly not differentiating at all.\n",
      "“Because I don’t like it,” I bite out. The nickname makes me feel creepy.\n",
      "That just makes her smirk. “But I’m pretty sure you’re about to scold me\n",
      "like one.”\n",
      "My brow furrows as I raise my chin to get lost in her emerald eyes.\n",
      "“Scold you?”\n",
      "Her eyes roll. “Look, I know I shouldn’t have knocked that kid into the\n",
      "water, but I was really mad. He was just so \n",
      "mean\n",
      ". And not accidentally. I got\n",
      "picked on like that as a kid and it was always my brother who stepped in and\n",
      "saved me. But Luke doesn’t have a big brother to kick someone’s ass for him,\n",
      "and I just . . . snapped.”\n",
      "I soak in the woman before me, a fucking knockout. “Why did \n",
      "you\n",
      " get\n",
      "picked on?”\n",
      "“I’ll show you pictures sometime. Taller and skinnier than everyone. Big\n",
      "buck teeth. Crazy red hair. Can I blame assaulting a seven-year-old on my\n",
      "hair color? I’ve always flown off the handle kind of easily. Or like”—her lips\n",
      "roll together—“I don’t get mad easy, but when I do it’s really, really bad.\n",
      "And Bunny sucks. Eye-fucking you like that at a child’s party.”\n",
      "I blink at her, frantically explaining herself like she’s in trouble with me\n",
      "when she’s not. The only people in trouble are the assholes who picked on\n",
      "her. I don’t care if it’s been a decade. I want names and addresses so I can set them straight.\n",
      "She carries on, oblivious to the way I’m looking at her and the hard-on\n",
      "growing in my pants. Oblivious to the way her fingers absently stroke my\n",
      "chest.\n",
      "“I know there’s this whole weird, small-town vibe happening where\n",
      "everyone knows everyone else’s business. And that bottle-blonde bitch was\n",
      "spitting mad. I imagine I’d be mad if I found out my kid was a raging loser\n",
      "too. But I don’t really care what she thinks of me, you know? So if you need\n",
      "to blame it on me to save face as the town’s grumpy prince, that’s fine. I\n",
      "won’t hold it against you.”\n",
      "I just stare at her. She must think I’m a real dick if she’s assuming I\n",
      "wouldn’t come to her defense on this.\n",
      "Her tongue darts out over her lips, wetting the full bottom one and\n",
      "making it shimmer in a way that I can’t peel my eyes away from.\n",
      "“God. Why do you have to wear a backward cap too?” Her voice is softer\n",
      "now. Raspier. Breathier.\n",
      "I swear she’s leaning closer.\n",
      "“What?” She’s a confusing woman, talking a mile a minute. We’ve gone\n",
      "from a scolding to teenaged trauma to small-town drama to my hat in under a\n",
      "minute.\n",
      "She really is kind of insane.\n",
      "“The cowboy hat.” She groans and lets her eyes roll back in her head. “Is\n",
      "so good. I mean, I feel like I’m living in some made-for-TV movie with a hot\n",
      "cowboy. But then you clean up and style your hair, and you give these hot,\n",
      "debonair older-man vibes.”\n",
      "I’m so confused.\n",
      "“Sorry?”\n",
      "Her fingers curl into the fabric of my shirt, and I feel the scrape of her\n",
      "nails against my chest. I love the way it looks; her pale skin gripping at the\n",
      "black fabric. I imagine lying her down in my bed, getting lost between her\n",
      "pretty milky thighs, and making her come so hard that her fingers curl in the\n",
      "same way.\n",
      "“But then, you go and turn a cap backward and give me the full rough-\n",
      "around-the-edges country-boy experience. Do you know how hot that is? I\n",
      "can’t even explain it.” She laughs lightly, like she didn’t just say something\n",
      "that broadsided me. “Hat forward. Cute.” Her free hand mimics grabbing the\n",
      "brim of a cap and turning it backward. “Hat backward? Game \n",
      "on\n",
      ". It’s like a switch.”\n",
      "I shake my head at her, watching the blush in her cheeks, the fire in her\n",
      "eyes. The trace of shyness on her face.\n",
      "“Well, that was altogether too much information. The backward cap is\n",
      "melting my brain cells. Gotta go!” She startles me when she pushes away and\n",
      "runs down the compressed path. I hear Luke’s voice taunting her, but he\n",
      "sounds far-off still. Her strides cover the ground but not the way mine do.\n",
      "The urge to chase her and hold her down consumes me. It has me feeling\n",
      "wild and untethered.\n",
      "Which is why with one sharp turn, I capture her arm at her elbow and\n",
      "push her against the prickly hay. Pressing her into it firmly, my hips lined up\n",
      "with hers. My hard cock against her flat stomach.\n",
      "“Game on?” I rasp out, as all my reservations about touching the nanny\n",
      "fly out the goddamn window. I don’t need them—definitely don’t want them.\n",
      "Not with the way she’s staring at me right now, eyes fixed on my lips while I\n",
      "grip her elbow and prop another hand against the wall of hay behind her.\n",
      "Her lip is still wet when she whispers, “Game on.”\n",
      "I want to shove her back and devour her—leave her struggling to breathe\n",
      "—but I hold that side of myself back.\n",
      "Because more than that, I want to thank her.\n",
      "I want to thank her in a way that my words won’t let me, so rather than\n",
      "mauling her like a teenager, I take a ragged breath and let myself drink her in\n",
      "for a moment. The pert tip of her nose. The thick fringe of her lashes. The\n",
      "heartbeat in her temple, just in front of where that beautiful copper hair starts.\n",
      "I release her arm and trail my knuckles over her skin, starting at her\n",
      "shoulder, slowly dragging them down to her wrist. I’m fascinated by the\n",
      "spray of goose bumps that crop up in the wake of my touch.\n",
      "My fingers slide between hers, her palm fitting so perfectly in mine.\n",
      "“I don’t know this game,” she whispers, and I drop my hand from above\n",
      "her head, pressing into her body with the full length of mine. My free hand\n",
      "slides into her hair, and I watch as I slowly comb through the strands, the\n",
      "burnished tone of it matching my tanned skin so well.\n",
      "“Me neither, Red.” My eyes stay glued to her hair. Truthfully, I don’t\n",
      "know what the fuck I’m doing. All I know is that I want to savor this.\n",
      "Savor her.\n",
      "Because I have a sinking feeling that when we step out of these bales,\n",
      "things will look a lot different. The dusty, grassy smell will drift away, and reality will seep back in.\n",
      "The reality where I know better than to go after a girl like Willa Grant.\n",
      "A reality where I’m still too fucking wounded to trust someone.\n",
      "“Are you gonna make a move, Eaton? Or just stand here petting me?”\n",
      "My head shakes and my chest rumbles as I chance a look at her eyes.\n",
      "Clear and certain, so bright.\n",
      "I feel safe when I’m scowling, but it’s getting harder and harder to look at\n",
      "Willa Grant without smiling.\n",
      "It’s with a smile on my lips that I lean in and press my mouth to hers.\n",
      "She’s soft and willing. She parts for me with such ease. Welcomes the kiss.\n",
      "Takes me.\n",
      "When I groan, she whimpers into my mouth, and I swallow her sweet\n",
      "little sounds. Wanting to keep them for myself, memorize them for a rainy\n",
      "day.\n",
      "It’s been years since I’ve been touched like this, and my chest cracks\n",
      "open at the feel. The contact. The closeness. The intimacy. Hands sliding up\n",
      "over my chest, pressing up over my neck before gripping either side of my\n",
      "skull. Dainty fingertips behind my ears.\n",
      "I didn’t even realize how badly I missed the attention of a woman. And\n",
      "not just any woman. The woman I’ve glued my attention to from the moment\n",
      "I saw her.\n",
      "The woman who’s thawed my icy heart in a matter of weeks.\n",
      "Heartless. \n",
      "That’s what Talia called me in her letter. And I believed her.\n",
      "I still do.\n",
      "But it’s hard to deny the feeling in my chest right now. The ache. The\n",
      "heat.\n",
      "It’s especially hard to deny the bulge in my pants. The one I’m grinding\n",
      "against Willa.\n",
      "That part does have me feeling like a teenager.\n",
      "She moans, hiking a leg up at my waist, opening herself to rub back\n",
      "against me, and I take that opportunity to swipe my tongue into her mouth, to\n",
      "shape my fingers into a fist in her hair.\n",
      "To go with the intensity of the moment, even though I thought I could\n",
      "keep it sweet and slow. That’s the thing about Willa. She doesn’t strike me as\n",
      "the sweet and slow type of girl.\n",
      "Every time I draw away, she pushes harder. Every time I glare at her, she\n",
      "prods, hoping for a reaction. And now she’s getting it. “Willa—”\n",
      "“Don’t stop.” Our teeth clash as she talks against my mouth. What started\n",
      "off reverently is quickly turning frantic. A well-crafted facade coming apart\n",
      "at every seam.\n",
      "I take a handful of her round ass, squeezing hard, before picking her right\n",
      "up and pulling her toned legs around me so I can rut into the denim covering\n",
      "her pussy like the sex-starved caveman I am.\n",
      "“Yes,” she hisses when my fingers trail over the torn hem of her shorts.\n",
      "She smells like oranges and warm grass, refreshing and comforting all at\n",
      "once. She feels like heaven in my hands. And she looks just as wild as I’ve\n",
      "always known she is.\n",
      "But there’s something about seeing her wild for \n",
      "me\n",
      "—giving in for \n",
      "me\n",
      "—\n",
      "that makes me feel more desired than I have in, well, ever.\n",
      "“Don’t stop.” Her hips swivel against mine as my fingers inch\n",
      "dangerously close to where I might find out if she’s actually wearing panties.\n",
      "I imagine inspecting her every morning. Bending her over the kitchen\n",
      "counter. Flipping up some flimsy sun dress that’s just her silent way of\n",
      "begging me to fuck her.\n",
      "“You’re desperate for it, aren’t you?” I husk against her ear, lost in the\n",
      "daydream.\n",
      "My tongue glides against hers, gently probing her mouth. The same way\n",
      "I’d slide a finger into her slick pussy.\n",
      "She whimpers the way she would when I add a second finger. And then a\n",
      "third.\n",
      "“Fuck,” she hums against my lips, because my hands are moving of their\n",
      "own fruition, fisting her hair and plumping one full breast.\n",
      "It’s all too real. Too much.\n",
      "Too fucking easy to imagine.\n",
      "By the time I realize how far down into this fantasy I’ve disappeared, I’m\n",
      "throbbing in my pants. Leaking in my pants.\n",
      "Like a teenager.\n",
      "Heat shoots through my groin, and I bite back any sign of what just\n",
      "happened. Willa is clueless, still soft and desperate in my hands.\n",
      "And clearly more than I can handle, which is why I step away panting.\n",
      "Needing some space. Needing to hide from my skyrocketing levels of intense\n",
      "humiliation.\n",
      "“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that,” is what I come up with. A douchebag thing to say, no doubt. But it’s all too much in this moment.\n",
      "I need my solitude, and I need to get away from Willa. Because staring at\n",
      "her all mussed, lips all puffy and pink, matching the stain on her cheeks while\n",
      "her full chest heaves and her eyes go glassy and wide, has me hardening\n",
      "again.\n",
      "I turn and stride away, hoping to get a grasp on my dignity somewhere\n",
      "between the hay bales and the back door of my house.\n",
      "Yeah, I run.\n",
      "Like a fucking teenager. 15 “W\n",

      "I snort. “Of course. My cookies bring all the boys to the yard.”\n",
      "Summer laughs harder, her wine sloshing in her glass as she does. “He\n",

      "Or,\n",

      "I don’t know how to take that though.”\n",
      "“You painted the front porch?”\n",
      "I scoff. Cade is such a stick in the mud sometimes. “We used paint to add\n",

      "Barbie pink or something.”\n",
      "She eyes me like we both know I should have said no to Luke’s idea. But\n",
      "whatever. We can paint it over. It’s not like we killed someone or threw\n",

      "passes out. Truthfully, I don’t know how he does it. It’s way too much for\n",

      "If I clean, he gets crabby. Oh! When he told me to stop doing laundry the\n",
      "other day, he said that I’m \n",
      "just \n",
      "the nanny, not the maid. So who the hell\n",

      "awkward\n",

      "I shrug. “Spending time with Luke doesn’t really feel like work.”\n",
      "In fact, it feels like the most natural thing in the world.\n",
      "I should have known when Luke asked, “What does it feel like when you get\n",

      "Instead, I kept bobbing my head to my favorite Broken Bells song and\n",
      "said, “Just like nauseous, buddy.”\n",

      "But I’m not feeling relieved anymore.\n",
      "Because Luke just sprayed vomit all over the back of my passenger’s side\n",
      "seat.\n",
      "I pull over on the country road. We’re only five minutes from the ranch.\n",
      "So close, and yet so far away. After running around the front of the Jeep, I\n",

      "“It’s a mess!” He’s crying now and I want to hug him, but we all have our\n",
      "limits. I’ve handled my fair share of vomit as a bartender, but hugging a barf-\n",
      "covered child is where I draw the line.\n",
      "Instead, I unbuckle him, whip his shirt off, and \n",
      "then\n",

      "Sobs rack his little body.\n",
      "“I-I’m s-s-so sorry!” He’s wailing now.\n",

      "don’t care about the car, babe. I’m more worried about you.” I pull away,\n",
      "looking at him, trying hard not to glance down. Because I \n",
      "know\n",
      " there is barf\n",
      "on me. The last thing I need to do is start heaving too.\n",
      "He nods tearfully at me. “Willa?”\n",
      "“Yeah?”\n",
      "“You have throw up on you. I can still see a strawberry.”\n",
      "I pop my lips open and opt to mouth breathe so I stop smelling it,\n",
      "focusing on his wide blue eyes. \n",
      "I’m an adult, I’m an adult, I’m an adult.\n",
      "“That’s okay. Everything can be washed. I’m going to buckle you in and\n",
      "drive the rest of the way. If you feel like you need to barf again, just tell me\n",
      "and I’ll pull over for you. Got it?”\n",
      "He nods, looking determined. And God bless his determination because we stop twice more on the way\n",
      "back to the ranch.\n",
      "The first thing we do is strip down outside. At least all pieces of barfy\n",
      "clothes. Which for him is everything, and for me is just my tank top over my\n",
      "bikini.\n",
      "The shower proves a challenge because he can’t stop retching.\n",
      "I’ve never felt more helpless. I’ve never felt teary watching someone get\n",
      "sick—usually I’m just annoyed—but watching his little body heave so\n",
      "violently has the back of my throat aching and my eyes watering.\n",
      "He’s finally clean, seems relatively empty, and just looks totally\n",
      "exhausted standing in the middle of his room.\n",
      "“When will my dad be home?”\n",
      "I check my watch. “In about an hour. I’m going to call him and get our\n",
      "clothes in the wash. Take a quick shower. How about you lie down?”\n",
      "He nods, standing in front of me, like he doesn’t quite know what to do\n",
      "with himself. “I want to sleep in my dad’s bed.”\n",
      "“Yeah, of course.” I know he often sleeps there on the weekends, but\n",
      "weekdays are tough because Cade wakes up so early. We’ll figure it out later.\n",
      "“Let’s go.” I hold my hand out to Luke, but he just nods again, clearly out of\n",
      "it.\n",
      "I touch his forehead and it feels hot. But maybe that’s from the shower?\n",
      "Fuck, I don’t know. I’d ask Harvey for help, but he isn’t back yet. Rhett is on\n",
      "the road. Summer is at work.\n",
      "I opt to scoop Luke up, propping his chin on my shoulder. His little arms\n",
      "wrap around my neck and my arms fold under his legs so that I’m carrying\n",
      "him like a koala.\n",
      "He sighs when I press a kiss to his hair without even thinking. I don’t\n",
      "know what’s appropriate anymore. I know he’s not my kid, but he feels like\n",
      "mine in some little way. He feels like mine enough to comfort him when he’s\n",
      "sick.\n",
      "I carry him down the hall, trying not to stress at how heavy he feels in my\n",
      "arms. He’s just tired. He has a tummy bug. Kids get sick. He’s not on his\n",
      "deathbed—or at least that’s what I keep telling myself.\n",
      "I nudge Cade’s door open with my foot and take in his room. The door is\n",
      "always closed, and I feel like I’m invading his privacy, but I’m also insanely\n",
      "curious. Like the rest of the house, his room is warm and airy, a total contrast\n",
      "to the main house where his dad lives. The walls are a creamy yellow, framed by big crown moldings painted a high-gloss white. The oak bed frame is\n",
      "stained a yellowish tone, and in most cases I would say it’s dated—but\n",
      "something about it works in here. Topped with a cream and navy plaid duvet\n",
      "set, the space is still masculine without being dark.\n",
      "It’s honestly not what I was expecting.\n",
      "Once I gently slide Luke onto the king-sized bed, I peel back the duvet\n",
      "and tuck him in. He’s already half-asleep, but he groans when I fold the\n",
      "blanket in tight around him.\n",
      "Peeking over my shoulder, I see the door to a small en suite bathroom.\n",
      "With a few steps over, I push it open, deciding this setup is ideal.\n",
      "The bathroom is tight quarters, just a toilet and a sink and vanity. It’s\n",
      "clean, and it smells like Cade’s signature pine smell mixed with something\n",
      "spicy and sweet.\n",
      "I momentarily wonder if it would be weird to just hang out in here for a\n",
      "few minutes.\n",
      "A small whimper from the bed draws me from my thoughts. I flip the\n",
      "toilet seat up—marveling at a man existing who puts it down in the first place\n",
      "—and head back out.\n",
      "Bending over a slightly delirious Luke, I whisper, “If you feel sick, you\n",
      "just go straight into your dad’s bathroom, okay?”\n",
      "He offers me a small nod without opening his eyes, and I run a hand over\n",
      "his forehead. Still hot.\n",
      "“I’ll be here if you need anything.” Then I press another kiss to his\n",
      "feverish temple and pad softly out of the room, already reaching for my\n",
      "phone and dialing as soon as I’m in the hallway.\n",
      "“Red.” Cade’s voice has a bite to it today. I’m sure some people would\n",
      "flinch, but I just roll my eyes. “Now isn’t a great time.”\n",
      "“Okay, it’s just that—”\n",
      "“If this is about your panties, save it for your morning text.”\n",
      "Dick.\n",
      "“Luke is sick, so get your head out of your ass and talk to me for once.”\n",
      "“Is he okay?” His tone changes instantly.\n",
      "“He threw up on our way back from a day at the spray pad in town. And\n",
      "then he threw up a lot more. He’s clean. He wanted to go in your bed, so he’s\n",
      "sleeping there. It’s close to a toilet, so that’s a bonus. But I know you wake\n",
      "up early for work, so I’m sorry about that too. I’m worried he’s too hot. Do\n",
      "you have a thermometer? What do I do? Do I make him drink something? I’m really worried I’m fucking this up. Also, I kissed him on the forehead\n",
      "and I’m feeling like I need to tell you that because I don’t know if that’s\n",
      "okay. I know he’s not my kid, but he just seemed like he needed comforting\n",
      "and—”\n",
      "“Willa,” his voice is soft now.\n",
      "“Yeah?”\n",
      "“Take a deep breath.”\n",
      "“I don’t want to. There’s barf on me and it smells terrible.” My voice\n",
      "cracks and I don’t know why. It’s like getting everything out of my brain and\n",
      "sharing it with Cade has me all up in my feels.\n",
      "“Everything is okay.” Who knew such a simple sentence could put me at\n",
      "ease so instantly. “He always spikes a solid fever when he gets sick. You’re\n",
      "doing great. We’re lucky to have you here helping us. Luke loves you. You’ll\n",
      "never catch flack from me for comforting him.”\n",
      "“Okay.” The words come out watery and I blink hard, trying to regain my\n",
      "composure.\n",
      "“Here’s what you’re going to do. Are you listening?”\n",
      "“Yes.” I sigh, already feeling relieved at having Cade take control of the\n",
      "situation. He’s so sturdy—there’s a dependability about him that I love. He’s\n",
      "practical. He works hard. He’s decisive.\n",
      "It’s a relief to have him on the other end of my phone.\n",
      "“You’re going to go take a shower before you do anything else.” Under\n",
      "different circumstances, the prospect of Cade ordering me to shower would\n",
      "excite me. “Then you’re going to go into the hall closet. There’s a digital\n",
      "thermometer in there so you don’t even need to wake him to check his\n",
      "temperature. Just aim it at his forehead. There is also children’s Tylenol in\n",
      "there. It might be hard to keep down, so you can always use the syringe and\n",
      "just give him a little when he wakes up and see what happens. Water or\n",
      "ginger ale—small sips.”\n",
      "“What do you mean when he wakes up? Aren’t you coming home soon?”\n",
      "I swear he growls. “We’ve got a fence down by the highway and are\n",
      "rounding up cows. I’m going to be late. Any other day I’d already be on my\n",
      "way, but I can’t leave them out by the road.”\n",
      "“What if I mess this up? Luke isn’t a martini I can just toss out and try\n",
      "again with.”\n",
      "The deep rumble of Cade’s laugh filters through the receiver.\n",
      "“You are not laughing at me right now!” “Willa. You will not mess it up. You need to believe in yourself. You’re\n",
      "smart. You’re capable. You’re determined. I know you are because you made\n",
      "me like you when I swore I never would.”\n",
      "“Is that supposed to be a compliment?”\n",
      "“You got this. I’ll be late, but I have total faith in you.”\n",
      "“Well then, you’re stupider than you look,” I mutter.\n",
      "“That supposed to be a compliment, Red?” is all he says before I sigh and\n",
      "hang up. 16 B\n",
      "Cade\n",
      "Cade:\n",
      " How you holding up, Red?\n",

      "y the time I pull up to the house, the sun has set behind the Rockies. I\n",
      "can hear crickets, and there are a few lights on in the house.\n",
      "I’m in a foul mood. The cows I can handle. It’s the cowboys that\n",
      "piss me off—sometimes I think I’d be more efficient running the ranch\n",
      "entirely on my own. I wouldn’t have time for a kid or family, but at least I\n",
      "wouldn’t have to listen to a bunch of yahoos wax poetic about my hot nanny.\n",
      "I told Bucky that if he kept wagging his jaw, I’d break it.\n",
      "Assholes just laughed and shifted to making fun of me for having a crush\n",
      "on her. \n",
      "Cade and the nanny sitting in a tree\n",
      ".\n",
      "Assholes.\n",
      "I told them they were all fired, and they just laughed more.\n",
      "Closing my truck door as gently as possible to keep from waking them\n",
      "up, I head toward the front door, wishing away my agitation. My worry. My\n",
      "confusion. I don’t want to step into this house as anything other than what they need.\n",
      "I’m halfway expecting Willa to be up when I step inside. That wobble in\n",
      "her voice on the phone has haunted me all night. It boggles my mind that a\n",
      "self-possessed woman like her can doubt herself so thoroughly.\n",
      "She’s all swagger and confidence ninety-nine percent of the time. But\n",
      "now and then, I get this flash of insecurity. It leaves me shaking my head.\n",
      "After toeing my boots off, I walk through the house on socked feet,\n",
      "desperate for a shower, but more desperate to check on my son.\n",
      "Willa too.\n",
      "I head to my bedroom first, absently wondering if it will be weird if I pop\n",
      "my head into her room to check on her.\n",
      "But those thoughts come to a screeching halt when I step into my\n",
      "darkened room and see copper hair floating across \n",
      "my \n",
      "pillows. The light from\n",
      "the hallway illuminates her creamy, pale arm wrapped around Luke’s tiny\n",
      "body.\n",
      "My heart seizes in my chest. Stops right in its fucking tracks. And I can’t\n",
      "look away. I let myself stare, shoulder propped against the doorframe, arms\n",
      "crossed against my chest—my only armor against the intense feelings the\n",
      "sight of Willa snuggling my son stirs up in me.\n",
      "I soak them in.\n",
      "I think about her saying she loves him.\n",
      "I think about the moment he reaches for her hand, the way he looks up at\n",
      "her—just a little uncertain that she’ll want his hand in hers.\n",
      "I think about the curve of his lips and the way his tiny shoulders drop on a\n",
      "sigh when she effortlessly wraps her fingers around his, like it’s the most\n",
      "natural thing in the world.\n",
      "I stand here and think way too damn much as I stare at them curled into\n",
      "each other. I let myself imagine things that I have no business imagining.\n",
      "Things I’m not sure I could ever live up to.\n",
      "With a shake of my head, I tiptoe into the room, hovering over them\n",
      "carefully as I reach out and lay the back of my hand over Luke’s forehead.\n",
      "Blissfully cool, which means either the fever broke, or she managed to\n",
      "get enough medicine into him.\n",
      "I sigh shakily and just before I straighten, her eyes flutter open.\n",
      "“Hi.” Willa’s voice is soft and sleepy.\n",
      "“Hi,” I whisper, and I can hear the smile in my voice.\n",
      "“Oh God. I’m sorry. He wanted me to lie with him. He got sick again. He got sick . . . a lot.” Her head turns as she takes in her surroundings. “I didn’t\n",
      "mean to fall asleep in your bed.”\n",
      "I like you in my bed.\n",
      "It’s on the tip of my tongue, but I bite it back, opting for, “It’s okay.” I\n",

      "pillow. “Just go back to sleep.” Luke is crashed out on top of her arm\n",
      "anyway.\n",
      "“Where will you sleep?” She blinks groggily.\n",
      "“In Luke’s room.” I should take my hand off her, but I stroke her hair.\n",
      "Soothing her or myself? Of that, I’m not entirely sure.\n",
      "“I’m sorry.”\n",
      "“Don’t be. Thank you. You were a godsend today.”\n",
      "“That’s overkill, Eaton,” she mumbles, nuzzling her head into my pillow\n",
      "to hide from the compliment.\n",
      "I wonder if she can smell me there.\n",
      "Thumbing some of her hair, I push it back behind her ear, letting my\n",
      "fingers trail over the line of her jaw. “You need to learn how to take a\n",
      "compliment, Red. A simple thank-you is all it requires.”\n",
      "“Oka—”\n",
      "I press my thumb against her lips, entranced by how supple they feel\n",
      "under my touch. “Red. Just take the thank-you. Now shut up and go back to\n",
      "sleep.”\n",
      "Her lips press together and she gives a firm nod. The motion makes Luke\n",
      "stir, but rather than waking up, he turns over and nuzzles into her chest, small\n",
      "hand splayed on her arm.\n",
      "I watch Willa blink down at him, like she’s still trying to wrap her mind\n",
      "around where she is and what she’s doing. And when she looks up at me,\n",
      "uncertainty painted all over her pretty face, all I can do is smile.\n",
      "Willa Grant looks way too good in my bed.\n",
      "“I think I watched a porno like this once.”\n",
      "My head snaps up from where I’m scrubbing the upholstery in the back of\n",
      "Willa’s Jeep. “Pardon me?” I pop around the open door and take her in,\n",
      "sitting on the top step of my front porch, wearing black leggings and a black tank top.\n",
      "She looks good.\n",
      "There is not a single place in this house this woman doesn’t look good.\n",
      "I can see the outline of her nipple piercings, but more than anything, I’m\n",
      "entranced by the way her pale skin contrasts against the dark fabric of her\n",
      "clothes. The way her fiery hair seems even brighter.\n",
      "“The grumpy mechanic guy with bulging muscles. A girl who can’t pay\n",
      "her bill. A tale as old as time.”\n",
      "“The shit that comes out of your mouth sometimes.” I dry my hands on a\n",
      "piece of torn towel. It’s a pale pink. Like Willa’s lips.\n",
      "“It’s the backward hat.” She points at me with a light chuckle. “You\n",
      "flipped the switch.”\n",
      "“Have you ever been told that you use humor to cover up being\n",
      "uncomfortable?”\n",
      "“Oh, yeah. All the time.” She smiles, and I shake my head at her in\n",
      "wonder. “My mom’s a therapist, remember?”\n",
      "“I told you that you didn’t need to clean my house or do laundry.”\n",
      "Her head quirks, the morning sun glinting off her smooth skin. “Have you\n",
      "ever been told you’re terribly particular?”\n",
      "“Willa.” My arms cross.\n",
      "“Cade.” She mirrors my motion with her arms. Except it creates a shelf\n",
      "beneath her full tits and I lose my focus. The scowl melts off my face. “I\n",
      "wasn’t about to hang out in a house with barf laundry just sitting around.\n",
      "That’s plain gross.”\n",
      "“You cleaned the bathroom.”\n",
      "“There was barf there too.”\n",
      "“The floors?”\n",
      "She grimaces. “Barf.”\n",
      "“Jesus.” I take my hands over my hat, pressing down at the brim over the\n",
      "back of my neck. When I peek up, I don’t miss the way Willa is eyeing my\n",
      "arms.\n",
      "There’s a part of me that gets off on it. But there’s another part of me—\n",
      "the adult part with all the baggage—that knows I need to put a stop to\n",
      "whatever this tension is between us.\n",
      "Probably not kissing her and grinding into her until I blew in my pants\n",
      "would have been a great start.\n",
      "Or not making her sit on the edge of my hot tub so I could eye fuck the way her bathing suit violated her.\n",
      "“I don’t mind. It’s”—her hand waves around in front of her—“whatever.\n",
      "I felt bad for Luke. You work hard all day. You didn’t need to walk into a\n",

      "“You’re not a maid, Willa.”\n",
      "Her lips quirk up and her eyes narrow. I’ve noticed this look. It comes\n",

      "Halloween one year.”\n",
      "I scowl at her. Internally I’m scowling at myself because my first two\n",
      "thoughts were:\n",
      "1. Does she still have that costume?\n",
      "2. How do I track down and kill every guy who saw her wearing it?\n",
      "She snickers and I ignore her. It’s what’s best for both of us. “You\n",
      "cleaned my entire house but left your own vehicle saturated with vomit?”\n",
      "Her head wobbles from side to side. “Well, yeah. It seemed like a\n",
      "problem for another day. I’m going to get it detailed. It’s not a big deal, so\n",
      "you can stop reenacting that porno anytime now.”\n",
      "“I’m almost done, Willa. It seems like the least I can do for you,” I\n",
      "grumble, ducking back into the Jeep, needing to stop staring at her and seeing\n",

      "porno\n",
      ".\n",
      "“Cade, stop. It’s seven a.m. and you were home late. What time were you\n",
      "up? Don’t you have work?”\n",
      "“I don’t sleep in, Red. And I’m taking the day off to take care of you\n",

      "she walked away. I get lost in shampooing the seat, watching the bubbles\n",
      "form and turn into a white foam.\n",
      "It’s a pleasant escape. Manual labor has a peculiar way of stilling my\n",

      "against the center of my back.\n",
      "I squeeze my eyes shut—hard—because I know who I’m about to face\n",
      "and I need to play it cool.\n",
      "But when I turn to Willa, I feel the pads of her fingers trail along my ribs.\n",
      "And then she’s standing before me, holding a steaming mug of fresh coffee.\n",
      "Wide green eyes look up at me—a hint of confusion in them. So many questions. And a softness that I want to pull out and wrap myself in.\n",
      "She holds the cup out to me. “Here. Seems like the least I could do.”\n",
      "And I realize that taking a moment with my eyes closed to give myself an\n",

      "Willa\n",
      "uke has managed to keep water, ginger ale, and some soda crackers\n",
      "down over the course of the day. He’s also snuggled the hell out of me\n",
      "on the couch, and I am living for it.\n",
      "At first, I wasn’t sure. Because with Cade around, I felt he should be the\n",
      "one soaking up the cuddles. But he’s kept himself busy, and I’ve caught the\n",
      "occasional soft look he’s given us on the couch.\n",
      "Luke’s propped against the end with his legs slung over my lap as he\n",
      "leans into my shoulder. He’s been twiddling my hair in his pudgy fingers for\n",
      "a while now—reminds me of his dad.\n",
      "We’re watching some cartoon, and I wish I could say what it was about,\n",
      "but I’m altogether too aware of Cade puttering around the house. Cleaning.\n",
      "Fixing stuff.\n",
      "He literally washed the baseboards.\n",
      "I’ve never known a man to be so tidy. But he’s also driving me insane.\n",
      "Sitting around while he works makes me twitchy.\n",
      "When he pulls all the food out of the fridge to wipe things down, I break.\n",
      "“Cade, you’re giving me a headache. Please come sit and watch some\n",
      "silly, mind-numbing cartoon with us.”\n",
      "“Hey!” Luke pouts up at me like I’ve just insulted some sort of Oscar-\n",
      "worthy performance rather than something that only holds children’s\n",
      "attention because it’s bright and flashes non-stop. It’s the music that kills me.\n",
      "It’s \n",
      "so \n",
      "bad.\n",
      "“You saying my mind could use a little numbing, Red?” Cade grumps\n",
      "from the kitchen without even glancing up at me.\n",
      "“Yes. You’re giving me anxiety.” “I’ll cook you something. You’re always less peppy when you’re full.”\n",
      "I snort. “Dick.”\n",
      "The sizzle of something in a pan hits me first.\n",
      "Then the smell of butter.\n",
      "Then the feel of Luke’s weight against my stomach.\n",
      "I breathe through my nose, trying to focus on the terrible TV show. How\n",
      "cute Luke is. How hot Cade is.\n",
      "Anything to rid myself of this growing sense of nausea.\n",
      "It’s when Luke leans close and puts one clammy hand on my cheek that\n",
      "things go south.\n",
      "“Willa, you have the prettiest hair,” he murmurs sweetly. But his breath is\n",
      "all crackers and ginger ale and damp heat and I can’t stay here anymore.\n",
      "I clamp my lips together and start fumbling with prying his legs off me.\n",
      "“Thank you, baby. But I need out.”\n",
      "His brow furrows. He looks mildly offended, but not as offended as he’ll\n",
      "be if I barf on him. I catch a flash of Cade’s concerned face as I literally jog\n",
      "down the hall toward the bathroom. The seat makes a loud clanking noise as I\n",
      "flick it open and empty myself with \n",
      "the most\n",
      " unladylike roaring noise.\n",
      "When the urge ends, I flush and peer up to find Cade and Luke standing\n",
      "in the doorway watching me. As if hearing me barf wasn’t bad enough, the\n",
      "two boys are standing there staring like they’ve never seen a person get sick.\n",
      "“At least you got yours in the toilet,” Luke says with an earnest look on\n",
      "his face.\n",
      "I can’t help but laugh as I look back into the bowl, the sound of my\n",
      "chuckle echoing against the porcelain.\n",
      "“Luke, go back to the couch.”\n",
      "I see his small form departing from the corner of my eye, but Cade\n",
      "doesn’t move, still standing in the doorway. He’s staring at his toes and the\n",
      "brass room divider where the hardwood floors swap to tiles.\n",
      "“You going to stand here and watch?”\n",
      "“I’m sorry,” he mumbles without glancing up.\n",
      "“For watching me barf? You should be. I don’t know how I’ll look you in\n",
      "the eye anymore.”\n",
      "He scoffs. “That you’re sick.”\n",
      "“Well, it’s not like you did this to me.”\n",
      "His head raises slowly. “No, but you were here taking care of Luke. You\n",
      "stayed with him all night. You helped him, and now you’re paying for it.” I hum at that, reaching for a piece of toilet paper to wipe my mouth,\n",
      "because if Cade Eaton sees me with barf on my face, I will dive headfirst into\n",
      "this toilet bowl and flush myself down it. With a small shrug, I glance over at\n",
      "the man standing in the doorway—tall and broad and imposing, with the\n",
      "sweetest expression of concern on his face.\n",
      "“He’s worth it,” I say, with a watery smile.\n",
      "Sadly, smiling makes me feel nauseous again and within seconds, I’m\n",
      "frantically waving a hand at Cade, hoping he’ll just leave me to be sick alone.\n",
      "He does.\n",
      "But only briefly.\n",
      "He’s back with some sort of war kit, and I watch him place things on the\n",
      "counter. Thermometer, Tylenol, water, ginger ale and . . . one of his T-shirts?\n",
      "“What are you doing?” I grumble as I wipe at my watery eyes, no doubt\n",
      "smudged with mascara.\n",
      "“Taking care of you,” he replies without even looking my way. His tone\n",
      "says that I just asked him a stupid question.\n",
      "“That’s fine. I can take care of myself.”\n",
      "“I know you can, but you don’t have to because I’m here to help.” He\n",
      "says it so matter-of-factly. Like doing this for someone is the most obvious\n",
      "thing in the world. And I wonder if, for him, maybe it is.\n",
      "He stepped in to take care of his siblings in the wake of tragedy. He\n",
      "stepped up to be a single parent to his son.\n",
      "Barfing babysitter? That’s a perfect job for him too.\n",
      "At his core, Cade is a caretaker. Selfless. With such a big heart I almost\n",
      "can’t wrap my head around it.\n",
      "He turns now, lips tipped down and brow furrowed. I’ve started thinking\n",
      "of this expression as \n",
      "resting scowl face\n",
      "—it’s just his default.\n",
      "I startle when he holds the thermometer gun to my forehead where I’m\n",
      "kneeling on the floor.\n",
      "“I’m just taking your temperature.” His face softens.\n",
      "“I know.” I push my hair off my face. “It still feels like a weapon to me.”\n",
      "He clicks the button. When it beeps, he frowns. “101.4—it’s red.” He\n",
      "turns to show it to me, like I don’t trust his ability to read or something.\n",
      "“Okay.”\n",
      "“Did it come out of nowhere?”\n",
      "I shrug. “You’re neurotic cleaning really was giving me a headache. And\n",
      "then it was Luke’s weight on my stomach and the smell of his cracker breath.”\n",
      "A deep rumble rolls around in his chest. “Well, if Luke is anything to go\n",
      "by, it seems short lived. The bad news is—”\n",
      "“I’m going to be barfing my brains out for the next several hours?” I ask.\n",
      "His head tilts as he swipes the T-shirt off the counter beside him, takes\n",
      "one step toward me, and crouches down to look me in the eye.\n",
      "Really \n",
      "look me in the eye. In a way that makes me realize he’s been\n",
      "avoiding my gaze or turning away when I meet his. But not right now. Right\n",
      "now, it’s all dark chocolate and warm caramel streaking across multi-faceted\n",
      "irises. I note the fine lines beside his eyes. On anyone else, they’d be laugh\n",
      "lines, but on Cade they lend to his rugged sex appeal.\n",
      "He smiles, making them crinkle even further. “No, Red. The bad news is\n",
      "that you have some barf on your shirt.”\n",
      "I close my eyes and groan. “This is my go-to style these past twenty-four\n",
      "hours.”\n",
      "“It’s okay.” His voice is like velvet dragging across my skin. “No one has\n",
      "ever looked better than you do with barf on their shirt.”\n",
      "Popping one eye open, I regard him warily. “Are you hitting on the barfy\n",
      "girl, Eaton?”\n",
      "He grins and reaches forward, fingers stretching for the hem of my shirt.\n",
      "“Let me help you, Red,” he says quietly.\n",
      "There’s nothing sexual about the way Cade takes my shirt in his fingers,\n",
      "but it doesn’t stop my pulse from racing or my breath from quickening as he\n",
      "peels my shirt up, exposing my bare stomach and plain sports bra.\n",
      "He’s such a gentleman, he doesn’t even glance down. He keeps his eyes\n",
      "on my face, even after I lift my arms and let him pull the shirt over my head.\n",
      "I will the nausea away, hoping upon hope I can hold it together.\n",
      "But even the beautiful man in front of me can’t distract from the feeling at\n",
      "the back of my throat, the smell of my shirt as he moves it away.\n",
      "“Sorry,” I groan before I turn back to the toilet, gripping the shiny edges\n",
      "as another wave of sickness hits me.\n",
      "It racks my body and I moan, which is right when I feel Cade’s calloused\n",
      "fingertips at my neck, gently lifting my hair away from my face. I spend the\n",
      "next minute of my life hugging the toilet while Cade fists my hair and\n",
      "smooths gentle circles on my back.\n",
      "I’ve imagined Cade taking my hair in his fist—but not like this. This is\n",
      "humiliating in a way I’ll never recover from. The magic is straight \n",
      "gone\n",
      ". When the urge subsides, I quickly flush again, wiping my face before\n",
      "turning back to the sexy-as-sin man who just held my hair and rubbed my\n",
      "back while I emptied my stomach.\n",
      "He continues caressing my back and, like the saint he is, doesn’t even\n",
      "look horrified by me. “It’s okay, Red. I got you.”\n",
      "I got you.\n",
      "There’s something about being sick that turns me into a child again.\n",
      "Helpless and pitiful. And the fact Cade is here and not annoyed is the biggest\n",
      "relief.\n",
      "I nod and he pulls his T-shirt off the countertop again before carefully\n",
      "sliding it over me in a wave of cool fabric. It’s massive but it smells fresh. It\n",
      "smells like him—pine. And that’s not a smell that’s making me nauseous at\n",
      "all.\n",
      "“You okay?” His expression is concerned but not panicked. There is\n",
      "something comforting about the fact he is so unflappable.\n",
      "“Yeah. I might just . . .” I wave a hand around the bathroom. “Camp out\n",
      "in here for a bit. My dignity would appreciate a little privacy. Don’t quite\n",
      "know how I’ll repay you for holding my hair back while I got sick.” I shake\n",
      "my head and let my eyes flutter shut.\n",
      "He laughs but it’s a gentle one. I hear him pull away, and I let myself\n",
      "slump against the wall behind me. The sound of him opening and closing\n",
      "drawers fills the small room, but I’m too tired to bug him about cleaning\n",
      "again.\n",
      "Neat freak.\n",
      "I feel the warmth of him as he approaches again. “Sit up, Red.”\n",
      "“Can’t. Too tired.” Why is barfing so exhausting?\n",
      "“You can do it,” he coaxes with one hand on my shoulder.\n",
      "“I’m going to get you sick,” I whine, still not moving.\n",
      "“I never get sick.” His thumb rubs sweetly across my collarbone, and I\n",
      "force my eyes open to look at him. “Come on, lean forward a bit.”\n",
      "I don’t know why he wants me to do this, but it seems like he’s not\n",
      "leaving until I do, so I comply, even though the rebellious part of me wants to\n",
      "lean back and say, \n",
      "Make me\n",
      ".\n",
      "It would seem nausea easily quells the rebellious part of me.\n",
      "“That’s my girl.” His deep voice vibrates through my bones, and then his\n",
      "fingers are in my hair, gently combing it back into a ponytail and wrapping a\n",
      "soft silk scrunchy around it. One he must have fished out of my drawer. I moan at the feel. At his words. \n",
      "My girl.\n",
      "God, I must be delirious. I chance a peek up at his stubbled jaw and stern\n",
      "features, while he carefully pulls my hair back. I want to melt into a puddle,\n",
      "and I’m certain that has nothing to do with the stomach bug.\n",
      "Grumpy Cade is hot.\n",
      "Sweet Cade is irresistible.\n",
      "With my hair secured, he meets my gaze, face lined with concern. He\n",
      "runs a wide palm down the side of my head, resting it at my neck. “I’m going\n",
      "to leave you alone now, even though I don’t want to. If you need me, I’ll be\n",
      "out there.” He lifts his chin toward the door.\n",
      "I’m not sure what to say to that. To him. To this. So, I just nod stupidly.\n",
      "And stare at his ass as he walks out of the bathroom.\n",
      "“Okay, up we go.”\n",
      "I’m faintly aware of the most masculine smell and the feel of gentle hands\n",
      "shaping my waist.\n",
      "“Come on, Red. I tried to be a gentleman and respect your wishes, but\n",
      "your wishes are bullshit. I stayed out of here as long as I could, and it drove\n",
      "me crazy to do it. I’m not leaving you sleeping on my bathroom floor.”\n",
      "That comment has my eyelids dragging open as awareness seeps back in\n",
      "that I am indeed still in the bathroom. It’s no longer light out and the kink in\n",
      "my neck is causing more discomfort than any actual sense of nausea.\n",
      "Cade’s hands slide into my armpits and lift me. I go with him, leaning\n",
      "into him once I’m standing. He wraps an arm around my waist to support me\n",
      "without even blinking.\n",
      "“Let’s go,” he whispers. I can feel the rasp of his beard against my ear,\n",
      "and suddenly I’m wide awake and intimately aware of the fact I have not\n",
      "brushed my teeth.\n",
      "“Go where?” I blink at him, groggy and still trying to get my bearings.\n",
      "“My bed.”\n",
      "I blink with more intention now. “Come again?”\n",
      "“It’s closest to a toilet if you need it. Don’t be weird about it. It makes\n",
      "sense.”\n",
      "His logic isn’t flawed. It’s the same reasoning I used last night with Luke. “Okay, fine. But I need to brush my teeth.”\n",
      "He rolls his eyes and I watch his jaw work. “I don’t care about your\n",
      "breath, Red. I’m not taking you there to make out.”\n",
      "I laugh, but my biggest question is, \n",
      "Why not?\n",
      "While I brush my teeth, he stands in the bathroom doorway, arms crossed,\n",
      "glaring at me like I’m an inmate and he’s a warden or something.\n",
      "When I finish, he holds out a hand to me, and I take it, letting him lead\n",
      "me through the quiet house toward his bedroom. I tug him to a stop outside of\n",
      "Luke’s room and peek in at his little body rolled up in a blanket with plastic\n",
      "sticky stars glowing on the ceiling. I can’t help but smile, relieved that he\n",
      "seems to be resting comfortably.\n",
      "“Was he feeling better?” I ask, before glancing up at his dad.\n",
      "“Yeah. He’s going to be fine. Fever broke and everything. It’s you I’m\n",
      "worried about now. You two are giving me some extra grays today.”\n",
      "I smile and drop my gaze. “Ah, well. They look good on you.”\n",
      "He says nothing, but as he pulls me the rest of the way down the hall\n",
      "toward the master bedroom, his thumb rubs soft circles on the protruding\n",
      "bone in my wrist.\n",
      "“In,” he orders, pointing at the enormous bed.\n",
      "“Aye, aye, Captain.” I salute, but it’s weak and tired, and I feel\n",
      "overwhelmingly relieved to be crawling into his bed.\n",
      "“Did you keep anything down?” He clicks on the bedside lamp and pulls\n",

      "mint flavor from my toothpaste. “You’re a big softy, Cade Eaton. Sit down.”\n",
      "“Here?” His brows knit.\n",
      "“It is your bed.” I pat the spot beside me. “Just keep me company for a\n",

      "“Jobs. Careers. Life. Being a grown-up?”\n",
      "“Do you like bartending?”\n",
      "I roll my lips together and regard my boss carefully. “Not especially. It\n",
      "was fun when I was younger. It felt like getting paid to be social. But going\n",
      "back to it will be hard. I like it out here.”\n",
      "His throat bobs and he stares down at his hands, not responding to what I\n",

      "I settle back a little, enjoying Cade’s comfortable bed and the perfectly\n",
      "supportive pillows. Has any bed ever felt better? “I don’t know. New sounds\n",

      "With my rig parked, I risk a glance at Willa. “You good?”\n",
      "Her lips roll. She doesn’t mean it to be seductive, but every little thing\n",
      "she does feels like a missed opportunity now. \n",
      "Those lips should be mine. On\n",
      "mine. Wrapped around my cock. Moaning my name.\n",
      "“Yup. All good. We’ll”—she hikes a thumb over her shoulder—“head out and look around. We’ll be back in time to watch your run.”\n",
      "I nod before gazing at the sea of people, thinking of how my life might\n",
      "have been if things had gone differently. Would I be here? On the road?\n",
      "Penning and chasing buckles?\n",
      "“Can we get ice cream?” Luke calls as he flies out of the back seat.\n",
      "“Yeah, we’re getting every sugary thing we can find because it’s still\n",
      "before dinner,” Willa deadpans as she gets out of the truck, and I know she\n",
      "said it just to pester me.\n",
      "“Score!” Through the window, I see Luke leap, a fist shooting up into the\n",
      "air over his head. The motion knocks his cowboy hat off, straight into the\n",
      "loose, dusty dirt.\n",
      "Willa’s head tips back on a laugh before she crouches down and scoops it\n",
      "off the ground, dusting it off while saying something to Luke I can’t make\n",
      "out. Whatever it is, it makes him giggle.\n",
      "She squats and places the hat on his head, giving it a little tug at the same\n",
      "moment the corners of her mouth pull up into the most infectious smile.\n",
      "I find myself smiling at them from where I’m still sitting behind the\n",
      "wheel. Luke is grinning even wider. When Willa reaches forward and boops\n",
      "the tip of his nose, I see his smile soften and go a little wistful. He boops her\n",
      "back and they take a moment to just smile at each other.\n",
      "Something in my chest cracks wide open as I watch them together.\n",
      "Kindred spirits in so many ways.\n",
      "They turn to leave, and Luke slips his hand into Willa’s. They’re cute\n",
      "together. He’s dressed like a tiny cowboy, and she’s wearing a white, old-\n",
      "school Pepsi T-shirt, a belt that looks more like a chain, and her hair in loose\n",
      "waves down her back.\n",
      "I imagine her wearing that belt and that belt only, but then my eyes travel\n",
      "down over her torturously tight jeans. The ones that display her ass like it’s\n",
      "the star of the show. The ones that flare out over a pair of snakeskin cowboy\n",
      "boots she borrowed from Summer.\n",
      "I’m going to tell Summer to keep those on lockdown, because they look\n",
      "too fucking good on Willa.\n",
      "She \n",
      "looks too fucking good. Period.\n",
      "And I want to punch someone. Because based on all the turning heads,\n",
      "I’m not the only one who’s noticing how good she looks. 19 I\n",
      "Willa\n",
      "Rhett:\n",
      " Where you kids at?\n",
      "Willa:\n",
      " Working on ruining our blood sugar. You?\n",
      "Rhett:\n",
      " Jasper and I just pulled up. Wanna meet near Cade’s truck?\n",
      "Willa:\n",
      " Sure, we’ll head your way.\n",
      "Rhett:\n",
      " I’m supposed to tell you to be careful.\n",
      "Willa:\n",
      " Of what?\n",
      "Rhett:\n",
      " I think my brother’s words were: she’s clueless that a bunch of\n",
      "dumbass cowboys keep humping her leg when she walks past.\n",
      "Willa:\n",
      " Cool, cool, cool. I’ll try not to trip while they do.\n",
      "wasn’t lying when I told Luke we were getting all the sugar. Being\n",
      "around Cade makes me want to drink, but that’s not an option when\n",
      "you’re taking care of a child. So I lean on sweet, sweet sugar.\n",
      "“I can’t decide which flavor I like better,” Luke announces from beside\n",
      "me as we weave through the crowd.\n",
      "“Why choose? Cinnamon sugar and brown sugar don’t need to compete.\n",
      "Mini donuts are a win, no matter what.” I stick my hand out to Luke as we\n",
      "press into the thickening crowd. “Stay close, bud. It’s busy.”\n",
      "Cowboys as far as the eye can see, right when I’ve realized I’ve only got\n",
      "eyes for one. Over a year of me making jokes to Summer about saving horses\n",
      "and riding cowboys, and I don’t even want the rest of them. I was \n",
      "fine \n",
      "until\n",
      "he took care of me. Held my goddamn hair up and rubbed my back. I still refuse to accept that people normally do that for their employees.\n",
      "And the fact he did has me overthinking things something fierce because, if\n",
      "I’m being honest, getting turned down is a new phenomenon for me. And I’m\n",
      "a little bit pissed about it. A little bit embarrassed.\n",
      "A little bit wounded because Cade is such a good man. I’d want more\n",
      "than just sex, and he doesn’t even want that. It’s a rough blow to what I’m\n",
      "realizing is my already fragile ego.\n",
      "I’ve never considered myself self-conscious, but the other night Cade\n",
      "made some points I keep turning over in my mind. Things about myself I’ve\n",
      "never realized.\n",
      "“There’s uncle Rhett!” Luke shouts up at me, knocking me off the\n",
      "winding path I got lost on in my mind.\n",
      "Rhett’s hard to miss with his shoulder length hair and cocky grin, one that\n",
      "morphs into a wide smile when he hears Luke shouting his name and sees me\n",
      "getting dragged behind the boy.\n",
      "“Hey, little psycho.” Rhett picks up Luke and tosses him onto his\n",
      "shoulders, giving him the best view in the house. He turns to me and nods his\n",
      "head. “Willa.”\n",
      "“Hi.” I return his smile. I like\n",
      " \n",
      "Rhett Eaton. I especially like him for my\n",
      "best friend. It’s the worst when your friends date someone you can’t stand,\n",
      "but that’s not the case with Rhett. They’re perfect together, and I can’t wait to\n",
      "see their insanely beautiful babies one day. That is, if Summer will ever\n",
      "hammer down a wedding date. Because she’d never do things out of order.\n",
      "“Hey, Willa.” Jasper pops up beside Rhett, several inches taller and\n",
      "looking like he wishes he were anywhere else but here.\n",
      "I crane my neck back to meet his blue eyes. They aren’t bright and\n",
      "sparkly, they’re deep and dark, almost navy. “Good lord, what are they\n",
      "feeding you Grizzly boys? Somehow, I missed you being this tall.” He must\n",
      "be at least six foot four.\n",
      "He smiles, but there’s something pinched about it. “Seems to be a thing\n",
      "for goaltenders these days. I’m lucky I fit the bill, I guess.”\n",
      "His self-deprecating response reminds me of something I’d say—\n",
      "chalking my skill up to luck or my hard work up to genetics. The difference\n",
      "is, he’s an NHL player and I’m a bartender.\n",
      "“Let’s head to the bleachers and get a good seat.” Rhett claps Jasper on\n",
      "the back and gives me a nod, and I follow him, Jasper hanging back closer to\n",
      "me. I feel like I’m being escorted by bodyguards. People get out of the way when these guys walk through.\n",
      "They also stop and stare. Some even say hi.\n",
      "When we turn up the bleacher steps, Rhett’s head swivels, scanning for a\n",
      "spot. Luke is still on his shoulders, pointing somewhere. Jasper moves ahead\n",
      "of me, long legs taking every other step. But when he glances back and sees\n",
      "me falling behind, he stops on a landing and then opts to take each step. He\n",
      "doesn’t say anything, but I know he’s acutely aware of us all staying together.\n",
      "It’s busy and these country boys are protective as hell.\n",
      "Only proven further by the way Rhett moves down a row and Jasper\n",
      "sends me in first, opening one arm wide and gesturing me through before\n",
      "following behind me. When we’re seated, Luke is beside me and we’re\n",
      "flanked by two tall men.\n",
      "Worse things have happened to me in my life.\n",
      "Luke immediately tells Rhett how he’s going to ride bulls when he grows\n",
      "up. Rhett and I exchange a look, knowing that Cade would probably keel\n",
      "over if this ever really happened.\n",
      "“Do you know much about this team penning stuff?” I ask Jasper, tipping\n",
      "my chin down to the ring.\n",
      "He nods. “Yeah. I’m actually not bad at it myself. We all practiced a lot\n",
      "as kids.”\n",
      "“Really?” My brow quirks.\n",
      "“You don’t grow up at Wishing Well Ranch and not learn how to pen and\n",
      "rope and cut and toss a lasso.”\n",
      "“Well, shit.” I lean back a little, wrapping my hands around one knee.\n",
      "“Color me impressed, Jasper Gervais.”\n",
      "He chuckles, eyes crinkling at the sides—which does nothing but remind\n",
      "me of Cade.\n",
      "That’s where the similarities end though. Jasper is quiet, but there’s a\n",
      "gentleness about him. He’s introspective. There are things that weigh on him.\n",
      "Years behind a bar has honed my eye for people who carry invisible weight.\n",
      "He strikes me as . . . sad, maybe?\n",
      "“Do you know anything about it?” he asks, eyes focused on the big dirt\n",
      "ring. There’s a pen with a bunch of cows at one end and a smaller pen\n",
      "nearby.\n",
      "“Not a damn thing. I ride fancy jumping horses.”\n",
      "“Okay, so basically a team of three will ride in. Those thirty cows all\n",
      "have numbers on them—three sets of ten—and the judge is going to call a random number. Then they’re going to separate the three cows with that\n",
      "number out and herd them down into the smaller pen on the opposite side.”\n",
      "I nod and turn my lips down. “Okay.”\n",
      "Jasper huffs out a soft chuckle. “It’s the rider’s job to predict how they\n",
      "might slip away. Bet you’re thinking that doesn’t sound so hard. But cows are\n",
      "pretty smart, and they like to stick together. Trickier than they look.”\n",
      "I laugh at that. The cows look pretty cute to me with their big wide eyes\n",
      "and round wet noses.\n",
      "“You’ll see them in real action when Cade pulls the cows up in a couple\n",
      "of weeks.”\n",
      "“Oh?” I tilt my head.\n",
      "“Yeah. Did Cade not tell you? It’s like a big family get-together at the\n",
      "ranch. We work all the cows. Get them vaccinated, check them over for fall\n",
      "—even though Cade is out there checking on them almost every damn day.\n",
      "Then there’s a big meal. Music.” He shrugs, staring back out over the ring.\n",
      "“It’s fun.”\n",
      "“That sounds fun. Too bad Beau is away.”\n",
      "A smile tugs at Jasper’s lips. “Yeah. It’s never quite the same without the\n",
      "class clown. But I think Violet is coming back. I don’t think you’ve met their\n",
      "sister yet. You’ll like her. She’s a fancy racehorse jockey. But it’s a surprise\n",
      "for Harvey, so keep that on the down-low.”\n",
      "I wink at him. “We’ll unite in our fanciness, then, huh?”\n",
      "Rhett must have overheard us because he says, “Jesus. You and Summer\n",
      "and Violet all together is going to be terrifying. Toss in Sloane? It’s going to\n",
      "be a mess.”\n",
      "Jasper freezes for the briefest moment. “Sloane is coming?”\n",
      "“Yeah, Vi told me the other day. She’s picking her up at the airport.”\n",
      "Jasper covers whatever that physical reaction was with a chuckle. “Yeah.\n",
      "That’ll be quite the combo.”\n",
      "“Who is Sloane?”\n",
      "“Our cousin,” Rhett says right as Jasper says, “Their cousin. My friend.”\n",
      "“Dude. You’re my brother. She’s our cousin. Don’t be weird about this.\n",
      "We’re too old for that shit.” Rhett shakes his head.\n",
      "“We’ve stayed in touch in the city. You know that. I’m not related to her.\n",
      "She’s a good friend.”\n",
      "Rhett rolls his eyes. “I don’t care about your last name, Jas. You’re an\n",
      "Eaton boy, like it or not.” Jasper’s cheeks flush a little and his lips curve up. “I like it just fine, little\n",
      "Eaton.”\n",
      "My head flips between them as they snipe back and forth. “Good god.\n",
      "You guys are adorable together.”\n",
      "“Sloane is really pretty,” Luke announces when he surfaces for air out of\n",
      "his giant bag of mini donuts.\n",
      "“Oooh.” I nudge my shoulder at him. “Does someone have a crush?” The\n",
      "boy rolls his eyes but his cheeks flame.\n",
      "I bite back the laugh threatening to slip out. Luke doesn’t need me\n",
      "making fun of him about this, no matter how badly I want to.\n",
      "The guys poke at Luke’s little shoulders until his ears turn red.\n",
      "“She’s pretty, Lukey. No one denies that. Right, Jas?”\n",
      "A little tendon in Jasper’s jaw twitches, but he nods and smiles all the\n",
      "same.\n",
      "“Look!” Luke points to the area behind the metal gates. “There’s Dad!”\n",
      "And there he is . . . warming up and looking sexy as hell. Shoulders held\n",
      "tall. Black hat. Black shirt with silver snaps. Black chaps. Black boots. Even\n",
      "Blueberry matches him.\n",
      "“I wonder if he has a favorite color?” I ask to a chorus of laughs.\n",
      "“He looks like Cowboy Batman,” Rhett says.\n",
      "“Ooh. I like Batman,” Luke agrees while nodding.\n",
      "Jasper chuckles. “He looks nervous is what he looks like. I told him I\n",
      "could show him some mental exercises I like to do before a game, and he told\n",
      "me to”—his fingers pop up in quotations—“take my soy-boy-woo-woo shit\n",
      "back to the city.”\n",
      "Rhett cracks up. But I find myself feeling a little defensive of him, even\n",
      "though I know they’re joking. Even that does sound like something dickish\n",
      "that Cade would say.\n",
      "“He’s got this,” is all I offer back with a firm nod.\n",
      "“Wonder if Blueberry will hold her own against these horses? She’s\n",
      "seriously outclassed with the fancy penning horses Lance hauls around,”\n",
      "Rhett wonders out loud.\n",
      "I toss an elbow in Rhett’s ribs. “Hey! We cleaned her up! She looks\n",
      "beautiful. Stop picking on them.”\n",
      "“I heard Dad tell Grandpa it doesn’t matter how much money Blueberry\n",
      "is worth because she’s the biggest bitch he’s ever ridden, and her mean\n",
      "attitude already makes her a winner.” I drop my face into my hands, body shaking with barely restrained\n",
      "laughter.\n",
      "“Jesus, Luke. You gotta stop eavesdropping on people,” Rhett scolds, but\n",
      "the big grin on his face kills the intimidation factor.\n",
      "Jasper pulls at the brim of his hat again, and I’m pretty sure it’s to hide\n",
      "his misty eyes.\n",
      "My gaze finds Cade again, sitting so tall, chin held so high. He oozes\n",
      "confidence, and I can’t help but wonder if he actually feels it.\n",
      "A cowboy says something to him, and his head tips back on a full laugh,\n",
      "reins held in one hand while the other rests casually on his leg. It’s nice to see\n",
      "him having fun after years and years of being responsible.\n",
      "I don’t regret my dare at all.\n",
      "Do I wish I’d dared him to take off my bathing suit instead? Sometimes.\n",
      "But he needed something for himself more than he needed that.\n",
      "Something where he gets to be Cade Eaton, the individual, and not just Cade\n",
      "Eaton, the single dad and tireless rancher.\n",
      "I must have a stupid smile on my face as I stare back at him because I feel\n",
      "an elbow nudge against mine. “It’s nice to see someone looking at Cade like\n",
      "that. Defending him like that,” Jasper says. “Like they can see him for who\n",
      "he is rather than the man circumstances forced him to become.”\n",
      "“Getting kind of deep for a rodeo,” I whisper, not wanting to involve\n",
      "Rhett in this conversation because it will just turn into a big joke.\n",
      "Jasper shrugs. “Wouldn’t be where I am today if it wasn’t for him. Would\n",
      "be nice to see him happy.”\n",
      "I nod because I agree. It \n",
      "is \n",
      "nice to see him happy. “Where would you be\n",
      "without him?”\n",
      "Jasper continues staring out into the ring, watching the first team ride in\n",
      "on their horses. He sighs deeply, and without sparing me a glance, he says,\n",
      "“If not for the Eaton boys, I’d probably be dead.”\n",
      "When Cade enters the ring, you wouldn’t know he hasn’t taken part in a\n",
      "rodeo in years—possibly decades. He looks like a king sitting on his horse.\n",
      "Thick, round shoulders and veined forearms. Like everyone around him\n",
      "should fall to their knees in his presence. My core twinges at the thought of falling to my knees for Cade. I wish he\n",
      "were less responsible. That he’d shirk all those pressures and just take me.\n",
      "I’d get off on watching someone as steady as Cade completely lose it.\n",
      "The judge calls out the numbers of the cows from their table, and Cade\n",
      "and his team members assess the cattle. When a buzzer sounds, time starts\n",
      "counting down and the three men on horseback jump into action.\n",
      "There’s something mesmerizing about watching Cade. He knows what\n",
      "he’s doing. So sure. So cool and collected. He’s insanely capable, and I’ve\n",
      "never found that as attractive as I do now.\n",
      "Capable in the ring.\n",
      "Capable at the ranch.\n",
      "Capable around his house.\n",
      "I can’t help but let my mind wander into the gutter, wondering if he’s just\n",
      "as capable in bed. I decide he \n",
      "must\n",
      " be. No man walks around unaffected by\n",
      "people’s opinions of him unless he knows he packs a serious punch.\n",
      "It’s that quiet confidence that has me crossing my legs and squeezing my\n",
      "thighs together, gripping the edge of the wooden bench beneath me.\n",
      "His forearms ripple in the sun when his gloved hands squeeze on the\n",
      "reins. The tendons in his tanned neck flex as Blueberry cuts and dekes, her\n",
      "head drawn low, eyes laser-focused on the cows trying to get past her.\n",
      "She has a mean expression on what is normally a sweet face.\n",
      "It’s hard to see Cade’s expression from under the brim of his hat, but I\n",
      "suspect it’s a mirror image of hers. All focus.\n",
      "I’m not familiar with this sport, but I am familiar with other equestrian\n",
      "sports—enough to know that nothing about Cade and Blueberry looks\n",
      "outclassed.\n",
      "They’re living proof that working a ranch every day is all the practice\n",
      "they need. Watching him work gives me goose bumps and has me brushing\n",
      "up and down on my arms, even though it’s warm out.\n",
      "Before I know it, they have two cows squared away in the pen and just\n",
      "the one is left swerving around Lance.\n",
      "Cade reaches forward and swoops a hand over Blueberry’s muscular neck\n",
      "before loping to his aid.\n",
      "And I want to be that horse. I want his hands on me. His weight on my\n",
      "back.\n",
      "It’s pathetic to be jealous of a horse—but here I am.\n",
      "I need to get over this. Stat. Pining is not my MO. Especially not over a guy who doesn’t want me.\n",
      "“Oh! There she goes!” Luke squeals and shoots out of his seat, pointing\n",
      "down into the ring where Blueberry cuts low, haunches braced as she spins,\n",
      "her mane trailing in the air she quickly left behind.\n",
      "“Get ’er, Cade!” Rhett shouts, up on his feet too.\n",
      "I watch Cade. He’s poetry in motion—smooth and balanced—as\n",
      "Blueberry heads off the cow and guides it straight into the pen with the\n",
      "others.\n",
      "I don’t know how the scoring works, so I don’t know if it was good or\n",
      "not, but I’m impressed, and that’s good enough for me to shoot up and cheer\n",
      "with Luke. The little boy beams up at me, beyond excited for his dad.\n",
      "“Wasn’t he good, Willa?”\n",
      "“Luke, he was the best! And did you see Blueberry? She’s perfect! We\n",
      "did good.” We fist-bump, and I catch Rhett tossing a questioning look at me,\n",
      "but I ignore it. I don’t know how much Summer tells him, and I don’t need\n",
      "everyone and their dog knowing I’m head over heels for Luke and well on\n",
      "my way to being the same for his dad.\n",
      "“Can we go back and see him?”\n",
      "“Of course, we can. You guys coming?” I ask Rhett and Jasper.\n",
      "“For sure,” Rhett says. “Let’s go give the old man some ass pats for\n",
      "putting on such a good show.”\n",
      "“He’s probably going to need a massage tomorrow,” Jasper tosses back.\n",
      "“Willa can do that for him,” Luke slides in casually.\n",
      "And we all freeze.\n",
      "Rhett looks like a goddamn dog with a bone. “Oh yeah? Have Willa and\n",
      "your dad been swapping massages?”\n",
      "“No. Just beds.”\n",
      "I make a choking sound, and Jasper holds a fist up over his mouth.\n",
      "“I got a stomach bug and Cade gave me his room for one night so I’d be\n",
      "near a bathroom,” I explain.\n",
      "“Yeah. But wasn’t he massaging you that night you guys danced in the\n",
      "kitchen?” Luke says it so innocently, but my eyes bug out all the same.\n",
      "“It’s . . . that’s . . .” I stare down at Luke.\n",
      "“What?”\n",
      "I feel my chest flush as I wrap a hand around Luke’s shoulder and turn\n",
      "him away from his uncle, who is enjoying this far too much.\n",
      "Moving my hand to cover Luke’s ear, I lean toward Rhett. “Watch it, Eaton. I know where you live.”\n",
      "“Yeah? What are you going to do? Come over and drink a bottle of\n",

      "When I glance up at him, his hooded eyes are locked on my hand. As he\n",

      "I moan, loving hearing that I drive him crazy. Gliding my hands over his\n",

      "He said he was going to fuck my mouth, and that’s what he does. I hold\n",
      "on for the ride, but it doesn’t last long. Soon his thrusts turn longer and\n",
      "harder, rather than fast and frantic. His pinched eyes remain laser-focused on\n",

      "“Willa, I’m going to . . .” He huffs out a breath as he trails off, trying to\n",

      "My eyes roll, but neither of us moves. Still standing out in the open on the\n",
      "front porch. Still trailing our hands over each other. “You don’t \n",
      "let \n",
      "me do\n",
      "anything, Eaton.” I arch a brow at him, and he pulls me into a hug, his steely\n",

      "And it feels so damn good.\n",
      "“I’m sorry I didn’t beg you to come home with me.”\n",

      "quell the slight pang of discomfort.\n",
      "Cade squeezes me tighter and presses a kiss to my shoulder. “I promised\n",

      "A pit forms in the bottom of my stomach, and insecurities leap like fish\n",
      "out of water, because standing in his arms doesn’t feel cozy. It feels like a\n",
      "cage. It feels like an apology. And all my walls shoot back up. I felt like a\n",
      "goddess two minutes ago, and now, there’s a sense of dread creeping in.\n",
      "I pull away, giving him a flat smile and sort of patting at his shoulders.\n",
      "“Well, let’s just not complicate it.”\n",
      "He gives his head a little shake, seeming surprised by my response. I turn\n",
      "and walk toward the front door.\n",
      "Am I being dramatic? Maybe. Probably. But my pride can only take so\n",
      "many hits where Cade Eaton is concerned. He can only turn me down so\n",
      "many times or make excuses about why this can’t happen before I take it\n",
      "personally.\n",
      "Complicated.\n",
      "I think the only thing making this complicated is him.\n",

      "hands fisted at his sides, in unbuttoned jeans and still no goddamn shirt, which is really just the cruelest kind of joke. His shoulders take up almost the\n",
      "entire doorframe, and his expression is one I recognize as his angry scowl.\n",
      "“What do you think you’re doing?” he barks out.\n",
      "I sniff and look away because he’s intimidating right now. “Making sure\n",

      "Three years?\n",
      "“I—”\n",
      "“No.” He holds up a hand. “I’m going to talk. And you’re going to close\n",

      "there, you wouldn’t have spent a single moment in here thinking I don’t want\n",
      "to complicate things with you. I said I \n",
      "promised\n",
      " myself I wouldn’t complicate\n",
      "this with you. You’re young, you’re restless, and I’m truthfully too fucking\n",
      "jealous to do anything casual with you.” He runs a hand through his hair,\n",

      "we’re not going back.\n",
      "“I . . .”\n",

      "In response she leans back and lifts her arms up above her head, staring\n",
      "me in the eye like this is some sort of challenge. I give her a small grin, liking\n",

      "with softer, more manicured hands. Someone with more money to their\n",
      "name. Someone with more to offer her.\n",
      "I drop my gaze to where my hands are touching her, where they wrap\n",
      "around her waist, right on that milky skin I was trying to catch a peep of the\n",
      "first day she stepped on my property. “Is this okay?” I ask, wanting to be\n",
      "certain I’m not doing something stupid.\n",
      "“Yes,” she hisses out almost desperately.\n",
      "As I push my hands up her torso, the shirt bunches. It’s like unwrapping a\n",
      "present, revealing silky skin followed by a simple nude bra with a lace\n",
      "overlay, tits round and firm above the line of the cup that cuts across them. I\n",
      "peel the shirt over her head and drop a hand to flick the clasp on her bra,\n",
      "pulling it away and tossing it on the floor beside us.\n",
      "I take a step back to appreciate her. She’s propped her hands behind her\n",
      "on the bed and is gazing at me with wide green eyes, a little intoxicated\n",
      "looking—but not on alcohol. Her breasts are full and heavy, dusky pink\n",
      "nipples erect and pointing right at me. Little silver studs adorn either side,\n",
      "sparkling in the light, and I want to fucking play with those.\n",
      "I want to play with everything.\n",
      "If Willa is the playground, I want to fucking play. Period.\n",
      "“You are \n",
      "beautiful\n",

      "would be. But goddamn, Willa. You’re almost too much.”\n",
      "The blush on her cheeks spreads down her neck and onto her chest. Being\n",
      "naked in front of me doesn’t make her uncomfortable, but hearing my words\n",
      "does. I click my tongue at her and when she looks back my way, I pin her\n",
      "with a scowl. “Thank you.” Her voice wobbles, but she gets it out all the same, looking\n",
      "fiery, chest heaving under the weight of her slightly labored breathing.\n",
      "I smirk at her and she rolls her eyes but her lips tip up.\n",
      "With a deep chuckle, I drop to my knees in front of her and reach for the\n",
      "chain belt looped into her jeans. “You want me to keep going?”\n",
      "She scoffs playfully. “How many times does a woman need to\n",

      "do you really need to hear me keep saying it out loud?”\n",
      "My eyes drop, and my hands shape her waist, sliding up to the base of her\n",
      "breasts. I breathe deeply around the heavy thud of the blow she just\n",
      "unknowingly delivered. When someone else chooses other men over you, I\n",
      "think you do need to hear it. At the very least, I \n",
      "want \n",
      "to hear it. Because\n",
      "Willa wanting me seems wholly unlikely. Totally crazy. Plus, hearing her say\n",
      "she wants it might be the sexiest thing in the world.\n",
      "I lift my chin and gaze into her bright emerald eyes. “Yeah, Red. I really\n",
      "need to hear you say it out loud.”\n",
      "Her lips pop open, and realization flashes in her eyes as she sits up\n",
      "straighter, hands reaching for me. When her fingers curve behind my ears and\n",

      "Touching her feels incredible. But being touched? Fuck. I didn’t realize\n",
      "how badly I was missing this.\n",
      "Her nails rake against my scalp, and this time she bends down to kiss me,\n",
      "so gently, so carefully.\n",
      "Until she bites down on my bottom lip, squeezes my head in her hands,\n",
      "and says, “Cade Eaton, if you stop undressing me, I will absolutely lose my\n",
      "mind and hide in my bedroom every night touching myself while thinking\n",
      "about how fucking hot sucking your cock on the front porch was.”\n",
      "“Jesus Christ, woman.” I pull back to look her in the eye with a little skip\n",
      "in my heart. “I won’t stop. But can I come watch that show sometime?”\n",
      "The apples of her cheeks go round as she smirks back at me. “Definitely.”\n",
      "And then she’s kissing me again, ratcheting up the urgency. Her hands grip\n",
      "my neck, while mine work over her breasts. They’re soft and firm all at once,\n",
      "a reminder of her age if I let my head wander that way—but I don’t.\n",
      "Instead, I just enjoy the little mewling noises she makes when I brush my\n",
      "thumbs over her nipples. When I pinch them, I push my tongue into her\n",
      "mouth and enjoy the way her hips rock in my direction, like she just can’t get\n",
      "enough. It’s empowering. It’s like a fucking drug seeing how badly she wants me.\n",
      "And I break the kiss only because I’m not done playing with the rest of her\n",
      "body.\n",
      "I know I’ll have lots of time to kiss her because I don’t plan to stop so\n",
      "long as she’s willing to let me have her.\n",
      "“These fucking tits have featured in my dreams for weeks,” I say, sliding\n",
      "my mouth down her throat, pressing kisses to the little indent at the base of it\n",
      "and working my way along her collarbone. A lick to her slender shoulder\n",
      "sends a shiver through her entire body, and I smile to myself because her\n",
      "reactions are just so damn satisfying.\n",
      "“Thank you.” Her head tips back, which makes her breasts press out in\n",
      "my direction like some sort of special offering.\n",
      "It feels like everything is dialed up a zillion notches. Every reaction is\n",
      "stronger somehow. Every feeling magnified. I can’t explain it and maybe I\n",
      "don’t need to. Maybe the lesson here is that I just need to relax and let myself\n",
      "enjoy something for once.\n",
      "Because I fully intend to enjoy Willa Grant.\n",
      "My mouth latches onto one nipple, and she cries out instantly. “Ah! Don’t\n",
      "stop doing that, Cade.”\n",
      "I suck harder and her body writhes. My opposite hand thumbs at the other\n",
      "nipple in a steady rhythm, the metal piercing adding a weight to it. My cock\n",
      "surges painfully against my jeans, and she’s not even totally naked yet.\n",
      "“I’m a fucking goner for you, Red. Watching you squirm? Listening to\n",
      "you moan my name? What am I supposed to do now?” I trail my tongue\n",
      "across her sternum before latching onto the opposite breast, strumming at her\n",
      "wet nipple.\n",
      "“Fuck me. You’re supposed to fuck me.” Her words are breathless, edged\n",
      "in desperation, and I love the sound, the vibration in her chest that I can feel\n",
      "against my lips.\n",
      "I drop my hand and press it against the apex of her thighs. Even through\n",
      "her jeans, I feel the heat. I know when I peel all these layers back, she’s going\n",
      "to be fucking soaked.\n",
      "For me\n",
      ".\n",
      "“Is that so?” I lean back a little and press my thumb hard against the\n",
      "denim. “Right here, Red?”\n",
      "“Yes.” She throws her head back, her tits glistening with my saliva,\n",
      "fingers fisted in the sheets. I rub firm circles on her jeans, chuckling darkly at the way her hips gyrate\n",
      "against the pressure.\n",
      "“Cade,” her lips part on my name, her tongue darting out to wet them.\n",
      "“God.”\n",
      "“He’s not here right now, baby. It’s just me. And I’m done asking nicely.\n",
      "I’m ready to take.” I pull one nipple into my mouth, swirling my tongue\n",
      "around the metal before clamping down on it. Her corresponding whimper is\n",
      "light and airy, just like her consuming laugh.\n",
      "I wrap her loose hair around my fist, pull her close and whisper against\n",
      "her ear. “I’m going to peel these skin-tight jeans off of you and enjoy a taste\n",
      "of what I already know is going to be a perfect little cunt.” A tremor racks her\n",
      "body, but I keep going. “Make you come in my mouth. And before you've\n",
      "even recovered from that, I’ll shove my cock into you, make you scream my\n",
      "name loud enough they’ll hear you one town over.”\n",
      "Willa’s eyes flare in surprise and she nods.\n",
      "“Is that what you want, Red? Let me hear you say it.”\n",
      "Challenge blazes in her eyes, her chin jutting out stubbornly. “Take it\n",
      "then, Cade. Taste me. Fuck me. Fuck me so hard I’ll forget my own name.\n",
      "I’ve never wanted anything more. I’m yours tonight.”\n",
      "My chest rumbles in satisfaction, and my hands work at the button on her\n",
      "jeans. “And when I’m finished, what will you say?”\n",
      "“God,” she breathes out so quietly I almost miss it, her eyes fixed on\n",
      "where my hands are now making quick work of her pants. “I knew you had\n",
      "big dick energy, but this is something else.”\n",
      "I yank at her jeans and she eagerly lifts her hips. “What are you going to\n",
      "say, baby?”\n",
      "“Thank you,” is her breathy response.\n",
      "“That’s my girl,” I grit out as I peel her pants off, dusting kisses down her\n",
      "thighs, feeling gooseflesh pop up under my lips where I drag my stubble\n",
      "across her tender skin. When I get her jeans past her knees, they catch on the\n",
      "tall snakeskin boots she’s wearing.\n",
      "“These fucking boots,” I grumble, moving back and grabbing them at the\n",
      "heel to remove them. And then I stop.\n",
      "“Do you like them?” She does that little signature arch thing with her\n",
      "eyebrow. I fucking love when she does that. A silent challenge.\n",
      "“I’ll like them a whole lot better when I get them off so I can see you\n",
      "naked and spread out for me.” She hums. “Summer told me they were good luck when she lent them to\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "I toss one boot behind me and reach for the other as I shake my head.\n",
      "“You women are witches. I don’t even want to know where these boots have\n",
      "been. Get them the fuck off.”\n",
      "Willa giggles, never put off by harsh words. She points her toe, and the\n",
      "boot slides off, which is good timing, because her naked and laughing is an\n",
      "aphrodisiac.\n",
      "The jeans are gone.\n",
      "The socks are gone.\n",
      "“You’re wearing panties,” I grumble, staring at her nude lace full-cut\n",
      "booty shorts. Perfect curves. My cock twitches.\n",
      "She nibbles at her lip. “You keep telling me to.”\n",
      "“Red, me telling you to do things”—I reach forward and tug at the top so\n",
      "they wedge between her pussy lips and sit high on her hips—“has almost\n",
      "never worked.”\n",
      "“Some days I do. Some days I don’t. Gotta keep things interesting. Plus, I\n",
      "keep waiting for you to check. Kind of hoping you’ll dole out some discipline\n",
      "if you catch me without them.”\n",
      "“Fuck.” I roll my lips together, eyes caught on the fabric disappearing\n",
      "into her slit. My hand trembles when I reach forward, and I still it by rubbing\n",
      "my fingers over the wet fabric that separates us. I groan when she sighs and\n",
      "spreads her thighs wider, palms still propped behind her on the mattress. “Lie\n",
      "back, baby. I want you to relax.”\n",
      "“I don’t know how I’m supposed to relax with you between my legs,\n",
      "Cade,” she says. But she also flops onto her back.\n",
      "“Is that a thank-you, Red?”\n",
      "She chuckles, but it’s all raspy. Deep in her throat, right where I was not\n",
      "so long ago.\n",
      "“I should pinch myself for how unbelievable this is.” My opposite hand\n",
      "grips her ankle, where I press a kiss to the protruding bone. Even her fucking\n",
      "ankles are pretty. “How unbelievable you are.” I prop that foot on the edge of\n",
      "the bed and push her leg open.\n",
      "“Thank you,” she says, hips lifting urgently as she does.\n",
      "“You still want me to fuck you, Red?”\n",
      "“Yes.” Her hands roam her tits, plucking at her nipples.\n",
      "“Beg for it, baby.” I press my thumb to her clit and watch her head pop up over the hills of her breasts.\n",
      "“Pardon me?” Her eyes go wide.\n",
      "It wasn’t so long ago she told me to beg in this exact room. This time, I’m\n",
      "running the show. Not her. “Beg, Willa.” My thumb trails down, and I press\n",
      "into her just slightly, seeing her legs tremble as the lace rasps over her soft,\n",
      "wet pussy lips.\n",
      "Her head flops back down and her fingers twist on her nipples. “Please\n",
      "take me, Cade.”\n",
      "Her back arches, and I drag a finger along the lace that’s skimming the\n",
      "edge of her pussy while continuing to press my thumb in, soaking the fabric.\n",
      "Legs spreading even further, her body shudders. “I need it. I need you.” I\n",
      "throb painfully against my jeans at the way she emphasizes the word \n",
      "you\n",
      ". “I\n",
      "need you so badly, Cade. Please. Please fuck me.”\n",
      "I lean down between her legs, taking a gentle bite of her flesh through the\n",
      "fabric, drawing a whimper from her lips. “And whose name are you going to\n",
      "scream when you come?”\n",
      "“Yours.” I internally beat my chest when her response comes so quickly.\n",
      "I pull my wallet from my back pocket, ready to pull out what is probably\n",
      "an expired condom. But she grabs at my arm. “No. I need to feel you.”\n",
      "Fuck. \n",
      "I want that too.\n",
      "“You sure?” She moans when I drop my head, tongue darting out to get a\n",
      "taste through the soaked fabric.\n",
      "Her hips swivel and she gasps. “I’m on the pill.”\n",
      "A deep groan rumbles in my chest. A possessive one. A satisfied one.\n",
      "“What a dirty fucking girl you are.” I suck her clit through the fabric, feeling\n",
      "her fingers raking across my scalp. “I’m going to fill you up, and you’ll thank\n",
      "me for it. But first, Willa”—I reach up and yank her panties down, taking a\n",
      "long look at the pink perfection before me—“I’m starving.”\n",
      "Her hands shoot up to swipe over her face. “Oh god,” she moans as I drop\n",
      "back down to take a proper taste.\n",
      "And then her hands land back on my head and her legs wrap around my\n",
      "shoulders, and I feel like I’m the one who should thank her. 23 I\n",
      "Willa\n",
      "’ve died and gone to heaven. I’m sure of it. Because the way Cade wields\n",
      "his tongue is out of this world. He licks me. He sucks me. He \n",
      "bites \n",
      "me.\n",
      "And then he makes me thank him for it.\n",
      "He’s reduced me to a puddle of hormones on the floor. Or as the case\n",
      "may be, on my bed, while he kneels on the ground and makes a meal out of\n",
      "me with one rough hand splayed against my inner thigh possessively as he\n",
      "slowly works two fingers into my pussy. I squirm and chant, “Cade,” like I’m\n",
      "in some sort of hot-single-dad-loving cult.\n",
      "I’d be the leader of that cult. \n",
      "For sure.\n",
      "“That’s it, baby, wide open for me. Are you clenching, Willa?”\n",
      "“I don’t know,” I breathe out stupidly before leaning up on my elbows to\n",
      "look down at him. He’s all dark and foreboding, his lips glistening with, well,\n",
      "me\n",
      ". “I’m pretty sure I’m having an out-of-body experience.”\n",
      "“Relax. I’m going to take care of you.” His thumb strokes along the\n",
      "tendons at the top of my upper thigh, making my head fall back on a sigh, my\n",
      "entire body relaxing as I do.\n",
      "His fingers slide home and I gasp when they curl up into the best spot. No\n",
      "man should be able to find a clit through jeans \n",
      "and\n",
      " the g-spot in one night.\n",
      "But the one kneeling between my legs can.\n",
      "“So fucking tight.” His fingers work in and out, and when I glance down\n",
      "at him, his gaze worships between my legs. I feel myself stretching as his\n",
      "fingers twist and scissor. “So fucking wet.” His coal eyes move up, roaming\n",
      "my body hungrily, appreciating every dip and curve. “I’ve never seen such a\n",
      "pretty pussy in my life, Willa.”\n",
      "Admittedly, I’ve never wondered much about the way my pussy looks. It’s always served its purpose just fine. She’s been a real champ, if you ask\n",
      "me. But I \n",
      "preen \n",
      "under that compliment from Cade. He’s older. More\n",
      "experienced. If he says it’s pretty, well, who am I to disagree?\n",
      "I lick my lips as I stare down at him. “Thank you.” The words come\n",
      "easier every time. The expression of satisfaction on his face is my reward. At\n",
      "first I was a bit fired up over it, but satisfying Cade—seeing that expression\n",
      "on his face—it’s quickly becoming a favorite pastime of mine.\n",
      "“Good girl,” he hums, touching my body so reverently that I squirm. He\n",
      "doesn’t rush, he doesn’t slam into me. His movements are languid as he\n",
      "wrings every ounce of pleasure from every corner of my body, and I’ve felt\n",
      "nothing like it before. “Now you’re going to come for me, baby.”\n",
      "The way his fingers move, his intense stare while he plays with my pretty\n",
      "pussy—his words, not mine—causes everything to build. The sensations. The\n",
      "way the shadows play across his handsome face and chiseled shoulders. The\n",
      "way they flex when he moves his arm. The feel of his fingertips pushing into\n",
      "the soft flesh of my leg.\n",
      "The sudden way he’s sucking at my clit while lazily pushing his fingers\n",
      "into me. He’s got the whole movement down pat. The curling and pressing\n",
      "rhythm. He plays my body like it’s an instrument he knows inside and out.\n",
      "And when the pressure winds through my hip, wrapping around the base\n",
      "of my spine, I grip his head and pull his face tight against my pussy, grinding\n",
      "against him as I topple.\n",
      "“Cade!” I call out, just like I promised him I would, as I come apart. Legs\n",
      "shaking. Toes curling. The arches of my feet cramp, and his movements just\n",
      "continue. He doesn’t stop too soon, like so many men do. He’s not eager to\n",
      "be done with the foreplay. This isn’t a chore for him, and I think that might\n",
      "be the sexiest thing about it.\n",
      "I smile up at the smooth white ceiling, cast in a golden tone from the\n",
      "glow of the lamp, and feel my limbs go soft. And with that rush of pleasure\n",
      "comes a rush of protectiveness. A rush of rage that someone could wound\n",
      "him so profoundly. That someone could stray the way his ex did.\n",
      "The resistance. The jealousy. The longing looks. The solitary way he\n",
      "lives his life. It all makes so much more sense now.\n",
      "And I have every intention of showing him how badly I want \n",
      "him\n",
      ".\n",
      "Pushing myself up, I rake my fingers through his hair, feeling his heavy\n",
      "breathing against my damp skin as I cup my hands around the base of his\n",
      "skull and pull his head up to mine. I link my eyes with his, staring hard into them as my thumbs stroke through the stubble along his chiseled cheeks.\n",
      "“Thank you,” I say simply.\n",
      "And then I kiss him. I can taste myself on him, but I don’t care. All I care\n",
      "about is that he knows I appreciate him. Our tongues tangle and his calloused\n",
      "palms dance over my ribs, somehow making me shiver and my core stir, even\n",
      "though I just finished.\n",
      "Correction: even though he just finished me.\n",
      "“That was the best orgasm of my life,” I murmur against his wet lips,\n",
      "drawing a chuckle from his chest. “Now lose the pants and lie back on the\n",
      "bed. I want to repay the favor.”\n",
      "His lips trail against my cheek. “You think you’re in charge now, Willa?\n",
      "That’s adorable.”\n",
      "“Lose the pants, mister.” I use a fake authoritative voice and return his\n",
      "kisses all the way over his stubbled cheek to his ear, where I nip playfully at\n",
      "the lobe.\n",
      "He huffs out a breath but pushes to stand, fingers working expertly at his\n",
      "jeans, corded forearms rippling. I absently wonder why I was so hung up on\n",
      "his grumpy face when he has a body like this and a sweet, authoritative,\n",
      "doting personality. What the hell was I even on about? I can’t remember.\n",
      "“What are you thinking about right now?” he asks as he shucks his jeans\n",
      "down, impressive cock tenting his underwear. I almost forgot how big it is\n",
      "and that I choked like an amateur when he thrusted hard into my mouth.\n",
      "“How hot you are. How insane your body is. How sweet you are.” When\n",
      "I rip my eyes away from his cock, his eyebrow arches at me as I add, “I think\n",

      "Thank you, baby.\n",
      "”\n",
      "He pulls his boxers down with a smirk, clearly not self-conscious about\n",
      "his body. “You like it when I call you baby?”\n",
      "I roll my lips together as I regard him. I fucking love it. It sounds so lame\n",
      "and cheesy to me most of the time, but when he growls it and tacks\n",
      "something filthy on to it? “Yes. I love it.”\n",
      "He moves around me, and I turn to check out his round muscled ass—\n",
      "Wranglers hold nothing to the real thing. Every part of his body is bound with\n",
      "strength, and not the type you get from too many hours in the gym. His\n",
      "muscles are real, thick and hard but not overly defined.\n",
      "His body, his skin, the crinkles around his eyes . . . it’s all just proof of\n",
      "long hours spent hard at work. And I’m not sure I’ve ever found anything\n",
      "more attractive than a man who works hard. He sits on the bed and turns, back pressed up against the headboard, chest\n",
      "puffed, long legs stretched out before him like a king.\n",
      "His fist wraps around his thick cock, and he jerks it a few times. I lick my\n",
      "lips as I watch him, entranced. I think I could happily watch him come just\n",
      "like this.\n",
      "His gaze heats on mine when he catches me staring. “Get over here and\n",
      "ride my cock, baby.”\n",
      "He doesn’t need to ask me twice. I turn and crawl up the bed, trailing my\n",
      "hands over the smattering of hair on his chest as I hike one leg over his waist,\n",
      "straddling him while his hands settle on my hips. I feel the steely length of\n",
      "his cock resting against my bare ass, and I give a little wiggle, moving my\n",
      "hips and feeling his hardness slide over me.\n",
      "Cade shoots one hand up to my chin, pressing a quick kiss next to my\n",
      "lips. “If you want me to fuck your ass, all you have to do is ask.”\n",
      "I prop my hands against his chest, fingers curling in at his crude words.\n",
      "“You’d probably make me beg for it.”\n",
      "He laughs, deep and raspy, and I feel the vibration of it under my palms.\n",
      "For a man who avoided laughing around me for so long, I can actually \n",
      "feel\n",
      "him laughing.\n",
      "His smile is a shot straight to the heart. “Probably,” he replies easily,\n",
      "before kissing me again. “Now take my cock and put it in. I want to watch\n",
      "you.”\n",
      "“Jesus Christ, Eaton. I’m going to be stuck in a permanent state of\n",
      "blushing after getting naked with you.” I reach behind myself, running my\n",
      "hand over his length, feeling how wet I am seated across his abdomen, legs\n",
      "spread wide.\n",
      "He huffs out a breath, thumbs brushing the silver studs on my nipples. I\n",
      "can tell by the way he groans he likes them. A lot. “Works for me, Red. You\n",

      "“Fuck.” My tongue darts out over my bottom lip, followed by a graze of\n",
      "my teeth. I push up onto my knees.\n",
      "With one hand propped on his round shoulder, I reach down between us,\n",
      "wrapping my fingers around his throbbing length. When I notch the head of\n",

      "It’s this moment where everything feels inevitable. It’s the anticipation that’s almost as good as the real thing. I can feel the dome of his head, just\n",
      "slightly inside of me. It’s going to be a tight fit, so before I let go, I run him\n",
      "against my wetness, swiping up and down, pressing him against my aching\n",

      "desperately. The feeling of fullness and not knowing how to respond to that\n",
      "comment draw my eyes back down, and we watch as my body stretches to\n",
      "take him.\n",
      "“Look at you, Willa. You take me so well,” he grits out, voice sounding\n",
      "strained and gravelly.\n",

      "Just for me\n",
      ". My heart aches, and my arms wrap around his neck. I kiss the\n",
      "top of his head. This strong, stoic, honest, hardworking man—one whose hurt\n",
      "runs so deep that he’s lived several years questioning his worth. His value.\n",
      "I hate it. I hate it for him. So, I rock my hips on him, hug him to my chest\n",
      "and say, “Just for you.” My nails graze over his shoulders and down his\n",
      "strong back. I bite on his ear again and nuzzle my cheek against his stubble. I\n",
      "love the feel of it rasping over my skin in perfect tandem with the rough pads\n",
      "of his fingers.\n",
      "I lift and drop down, taking his full length in one go and hissing against\n",
      "his cheek at the slight burn. “Just for you,” I whisper again.\n",
      "And I think I mean it.\n",
      "Who the fuck knows what I’m doing? I’m positive that I don’t. Or I don’t\n",
      "most days. I go with the flow. I take my opportunities.\n",
      "And God, an opportunity has never felt this right, so I don’t question it. I\n",
      "don’t overthink it. I give myself over to it.\n",
      "To him. I pull his head up to me and kiss him like it’s our last moment on earth.\n",
      "The energy in the small bedroom changes. What started off as rough and\n",
      "turned playful, has morphed into something more sensitive. But now we’re\n",
      "more frantic.\n",
      "Our hands roam. He grips my ass, lifting me and pushing me back down.\n",
      "My legs shake and my head tips back. His beard scrapes across my chest. His\n",
      "lips work my nipples. My hands tug his hair.\n",
      "We don’t talk.\n",
      "But we don’t need to. Our bodies do the talking. Our kisses are wet, and\n",
      "messy, and perfectly imperfect.\n",
      "“Cade,” I whimper, as wet slapping noises fill the room, followed by his\n",
      "animalistic grunts. My tits are bouncing. His eyes are glassy. “I think I’m\n",
      "going to . . .” I trail off, hot and breathless and totally out of control. Utterly\n",
      "consumed. But he knows what I’m trying to say. He knows what I need.\n",
      "What I want.\n",
      "One hand splays over my stomach, and his fingers swipe over my bud.\n",
      "“Come for me, baby,” he pants.\n",
      "“Yes,” I hiss. “Please don’t stop.”\n",
      "“Never,” is his response. And it sets me off, the surety of it striking\n",
      "something in me that causes an eruption.\n",
      "“Cade!” I scream his name this time. I don’t just call it. I let loose, and\n",
      "god, it feels incredible.\n",
      "We’re a tangle of moans and taut muscles. His fingers keep moving, but\n",
      "his hand lands on my shoulder and clamps me onto his body as his cock\n",
      "surges, twitching and throbbing.\n",
      "He spills himself inside me as he whispers my name against my lips, and\n",
      "there’s something intensely personal about it. I’m trying to catch my breath. I\n",
      "told him I’d say thank you, and I want to keep all my promises to him. He’s\n",
      "seen too many broken ones in his life.\n",
      "He crushes me to him in the wake of our orgasms. It feels like he wraps\n",
      "his entire body around me. I nuzzle in closer, with him still inside me, damp\n",
      "chest against my cheek, steely arms clutching me around my back.\n",
      "I open my lips to say the words he wanted.\n",
      "But it’s him who drops his cheek against my head and rasps, “Thank\n",
      "you.” 24 I\n",
      "Cade\n",
      "wake up hot and hard.\n",
      "And smiling.\n",
      "Willa’s hair is in my face, and her breath is making my neck feel\n",
      "damp and sweaty. She’s sprawled her long limbs over mine and pressed her\n",
      "body so close that all I’d have to do is shift her a few inches and she’d be\n",
      "lying right on top of me.\n",
      "I’m not especially comfortable. And I fucking love it.\n",
      "I always kind of chalked up my dry streak to aging, to being past it at\n",
      "thirty-eight. I know I’m not old but I feel old some days. Worn out and\n",
      "lacking the energy it takes to start a new relationship. Too tired to deal with\n",
      "the highs and the lows and the inevitable drama.\n",
      "But Willa Grant invigorates me.\n",
      "After having the best sex of my life, I dragged her to the kitchen and fed\n",
      "her. I made us pancakes. We talked. We laughed. But when she smudged a\n",
      "bit of syrup on her lips, I couldn’t resist licking it off. And that turned into me\n",
      "getting her on all fours, right on the hardwood floor in the kitchen. Which\n",
      "turned into a shower. Which turned into slamming her into the tile wall until\n",
      "we both came again.\n",
      "She told me she couldn’t take anymore, but when I yanked her into my\n",
      "bed with me, I disappeared beneath the covers for one more taste. And it\n",
      "turns out she’s a big fat liar because she absolutely took more.\n",
      "I should be exhausted right now, but apparently my dick didn’t get the\n",
      "memo. Because he’s up and ready to defile the twenty-five-year-old sprawled\n",
      "out in my bed. Again.\n",
      "“Down, boy,” I murmur, reaching to adjust myself in my boxers. Willa stirs when I move, but my opposite arm comes around to the dimples at the\n",
      "small of her back, pressing her against me.\n",
      "I don’t care if it’s physically uncomfortable. Having Willa close is\n",
      "comforting. It’s like having Luke under the same roof. I know everyone is\n",
      "safe.\n",
      "I wish I could say I felt the same way about Luke’s mom. But I don’t.\n",
      "The only times Talia crosses my mind are when I’m feeling wounded or\n",
      "insecure. When that bitter taste crawls up my throat and I think about the\n",
      "years I wasted trying to make things work with her when deep down I didn’t\n",
      "want them to.\n",
      "The worst part is, I can’t bring myself to regret it because I have Luke.\n",
      "And he’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me.\n",
      "Willa moves her head to my chest, sliding her fingers through the sparse\n",
      "hair. “Shh. Go back to sleep. I’m having the best dream.”\n",
      "The thought that Willa is another of the best things in my life crops up,\n",
      "but it scares me. It feels too soon. She feels too young. It feels\n",
      "too . . . impossible.\n",
      "“What are you dreaming about, Red?” I lift my head and drop a kiss to\n",
      "her silky hair.\n",
      "I feel her chest shake a little, her breasts pressing against me. Even the\n",
      "metal of her piercings is warm, because of course she sleeps naked. “That my\n",
      "hot boss banged my brains out last night.”\n",
      "I shake my head.\n",
      "“No, for real. You should see this fucking guy. All dark and broody with\n",
      "a massive dick.”\n",
      "“Willa.”\n",
      "“These big, calloused hands to go with his big, round ass—”\n",
      "“Woman.” I flip her onto her back, the sound of her giggle music to my\n",
      "ears. I lie on top of her, propped on my elbows. She’s got this playful smile\n",
      "on her face and creases on her cheek from the pillowcase. She looks like a\n",
      "sleepy, creamy, green-eyed goddess.\n",
      "I shake my head at her again. I do that a lot. It used to be out of\n",
      "annoyance, now it’s more like . . . disbelief.\n",
      "“Is \n",
      "woman \n",
      "how you say, \n",
      "Thank you for all the compliments, Willa\n",
      "?”\n",
      "“Keep teasing me and I’ll fill your throat with my cock to shut you up\n",
      "again,” I grumble, but it’s playful. And she knows it. She’s figured out how\n",
      "to interpret me, rather than being offended by me. She knows when I’m joking, or when I’m grumpy. And when I am, she just rolls her eyes at me or\n",
      "walks away.\n",
      "I guess that’s why she opens her mouth like she’s ready to take me there\n",
      "again, but then her eyes widen, and she slams a hand over it. “Oh my God.\n",
      "Morning breath. I’m sorry.”\n",
      "I laugh. After what we did last night, a little morning breath won’t scare\n",
      "me off. “Willa, I was with you while you were barfing. Your breath will\n",
      "never be worse than that.”\n",
      "She gasps from behind her palm like she’s offended. “Asshole!” And that\n",
      "just makes me laugh harder.\n",
      "I press a kiss to her forehead before leaning over to whisper in her ear,\n",
      "“Lucky for you, I won’t be able to smell your breath with my dick in your\n",
      "mouth.”\n",
      "She laughs silently at that, covering her face with both hands as her body\n",
      "shakes. I flop down beside her and let her infectious happiness take me over.\n",
      "We lie here—laughing, hands roaming, bodies tangled—but before long,\n",
      "she pulls me back on top of her, slides down my body, and tells me to fuck\n",
      "her mouth.\n",
      "“Okay, so like . . .” Willa wrings her hands in her lap as I start the truck. It’s\n",
      "like stepping outside of my house has reality crashing down all around us,\n",
      "and she’s freaking out. “How are we handling this?”\n",
      "I should be freaking out but I feel remarkably calm. Something about this\n",
      "is just too right to get worked up over. I live in my head enough to know\n",
      "when I’m losing my shit, and I’m definitely not.\n",
      "“Handling what?” I reply, as I shift into drive and watch behind myself\n",
      "out of habit. I still check for my old dog, who was always ripping around the\n",
      "farm, burning off his endless energy. The dog Talia took with her. She\n",
      "literally said she wanted “the dog or the kid.” I still can’t believe those words\n",
      "came out of her mouth. There was no question about that for me. Anyone\n",
      "who put those two on the same priority level was sure as shit not going to be\n",
      "raising my child.\n",
      "“This. What happened between us. All the sex. Are we doing more of\n",
      "that? Or is it a one-and-done scenario?” One of my cheeks quirk up. “I think you mean six and done, baby.”\n",
      "“Don’t \n",
      "baby\n",
      " me right now, Eaton. I’m serious.”\n",
      "“Me too, Red. Should I pull over? We can make it seven and counting.”\n",
      "“I hate you.” She crosses her arms like she’s pouting. I know better. Willa\n",
      "isn’t a pouter.\n",
      "“Right. But you love my dick.”\n",
      "She sucks in a deep breath and then lets out this adorable frustrated\n",
      "growl. “Weeks and weeks of you being a humorless asshole, and all it took\n",
      "was a few orgasms for you to become Mr. Chucklehead. I should have taken\n",
      "one for the team sooner.”\n",
      "I twist my fingers on the steering wheel, trying to hold back my laughter.\n",
      "“I think you should continue to take it for the team.”\n",
      "Her head whips over to look at me. “Yeah?”\n",
      "I shrug, keeping my eyes on the gravel road ahead of me. “Yeah.\n",
      "Definitely.”\n",
      "“Why?”\n",
      "I glance at her now. Her eyes are narrowed, and I can see the insecurity\n",
      "written all over her face. Goddamn, but this girl puts on a good show.\n",
      "“Because I like you, Willa.”\n",
      "She points at me and tries to correct my statement. “You like to have sex\n",
      "with me.”\n",
      "I stop the truck in the middle of the road. There’s no traffic so it doesn’t\n",
      "matter. And honestly, even if there were, they could all just fucking wait\n",
      "while I set this woman straight.\n",
      "I turn to face her, one hand slung over the wheel. My posture might seem\n",
      "casual but my expression is not. She must take notice because I watch her\n",
      "shoulders shimmy as she sits up straighter and scans my face.\n",
      "“No, Willa. I like \n",
      "you. \n",
      "I care about \n",
      "you\n",
      ". I didn’t go without sex for years\n",
      "just to start it back up randomly. I had opportunities, and I turned them down\n",
      "because I wasn’t interested. We don’t need to make a show of it, and with\n",
      "Luke around, we probably shouldn’t. But I’m interested in \n",
      "you\n",
      ". I don’t know\n",
      "where that leaves us or what it all means. All I know is that it’s going to\n",
      "fucking wreck me when you leave at the end of this summer, but I’m too far\n",
      "gone to care.”\n",
      "Her lips pop open like she’s about to say something, but she closes them\n",
      "again. I can see her processing. She’s so expressive, nothing is locked up\n",
      "with a face like that. I can read her far too easily. She doesn’t say it, but she looks happy with my response.\n",
      "What she says is, “Thank you.”\n",
      "I give her a firm nod, put the truck in drive, and reach across the console,\n",
      "palm open. Within seconds she slides her slender fingers between mine, and I\n",
      "wrap her hand up, giving her a quick squeeze as we drive to the main\n",
      "farmhouse in a stunned but companionable silence.\n",
      "“Dad!” Luke flies around the corner of my father’s house like a bat out of\n",
      "hell as I stride around the front of my truck to open Willa’s door. I swear this\n",
      "kid never stops running . . . jumping . . . climbing. He’s taken years off my\n",
      "life for sure. “Willa!” he cries, when he sees her step out of the vehicle.\n",
      "“You’re not my chauffeur, you know,” she murmurs as she takes my\n",
      "hand to hop down.\n",
      "“I’ll add not opening your car door to the list of offenses—that includes\n",
      "not eating your pussy—from past men.”\n",
      "She blushes and drops my hand, stepping away.\n",
      "Keeping our hands off each other is going to be fucking torture. I can tell\n",
      "by the way her fingers trailed over my palm, like she wanted to hold contact\n",
      "for as long as possible.\n",
      "Luckily for my ego, Luke launches himself at me first. I pull him up\n",
      "against me, noting how much heavier he’s grown. How much taller. He’s\n",
      "getting bigger faster than I care for. Growing up way too damn fast.\n",
      "“Hey, pal. You have a good sleepover?”\n",
      "“The best!” He smacks a loud kiss on my cheek, and I wonder what age\n",
      "he’ll stop doing that.\n",
      "He pops down and does the same to Willa, except he wraps his arms\n",
      "around her waist. She doubles over, hair fanning around him as she hugs him\n",
      "back and whispers something private to him. Luke giggles, and Willa rubs a\n",
      "hand across the back of his head before dropping a quick kiss to his crown.\n",
      "I stare at them like a lovesick fool, imagining something I’ve never let\n",
      "myself imagine. Luke’s had plenty of caretakers over the years—teachers,\n",
      "friends—but he’s never been as taken with a single person as he is with\n",
      "Willa. He’s needed someone like her in his life so badly.\n",
      "And I guess that makes two of us because I can’t take my eyes off them.\n",
      "“You having a stroke, son?” My dickhead dad calls from the front porch,\n",
      "actually making me jump.\n",
      "I prop my hands on my hips, giving him my best say-nothing glare.\n",
      "He’s not a stupid man. He’s grinning at me like he knows something. And I’m sure he does. I just don’t need him making it weird by making some joke\n",
      "about us giving the lawn a blow job or whatever shit he comes up with for\n",
      "entertainment.\n",
      "I can’t wait to be old and retired and say things just to see how people\n",
      "will react to get my kicks. That’s the dream right there.\n",
      "“Just tired,” is what I opt to respond with.\n",
      "Harvey props himself against the post on the front porch with a knowing\n",
      "grin. “That’s what happens when you stay up too late partying at your age.”\n",
      "Willa stands up straight now, arm slung around Luke, who is still clinging\n",
      "to her. “I was the one out partying. Cade stayed home to, uh, clean the house.\n",
      "He’s very tidy. You did well in that department.”\n",
      "My dad scoffs. “That boy only cleans when he’s anxious.”\n",
      "Dick\n",
      ".\n",
      "“Well then, his anxiety must be off the charts,” Willa quips, trying to\n",
      "keep things light. Her bartender banter is on point, but my dad doesn’t fall for\n",
      "it.\n",
      "“He’s looking mighty relaxed this morning,” he replies, grinning ear-to-\n",
      "ear.\n",
      "“Jesus Christ,” I mutter, kicking at a stone in the packed dirt beneath my\n",
      "work boot.\n",
      "Willa snickers and looks away. We both know we’re busted. Old\n",
      "Harvey’s fucking eagle eyes never miss a beat. And that’s what I get for\n",
      "staring at Willa like she hung the moon.\n",
      "It’s been all of ten minutes since we left the house, and I’m already\n",
      "failing at keeping things between us under wraps. There’s a part of me that\n",
      "doesn’t want to, but I also don’t want all the pitying looks when she leaves.\n",
      "The throat clearing and the back pats. And if people don’t know about us,\n",
      "they won’t know why I’m miserable. And that just feels a lot more bearable\n",
      "to me.\n",
      "“What’s the plan today?” I stare down at Luke, opting to ignore my dad\n",
      "entirely.\n",
      "“Planning my birthday! Willa, you’ll come right? Even though it’s on the\n",
      "weekend?”\n",
      "She smiles down at him, giving his small shoulders a tight squeeze.\n",
      "“Wouldn’t miss it.”\n",
      "“Will you play happy birthday to me on your guitar?”\n",
      "She laughs and my dick goes hard. Watching Willa play the guitar is up there for me. All unplugged and stripped down, just her soft raspy voice and\n",
      "the gentle strumming of her dainty fingers, with long hair splayed against the\n",
      "stained wood.\n",
      "It’s almost as hot as watching her sit on a bucking horse and stick the\n",
      "ride.\n",
      "“I have an even better idea,” Willa says. “I’ll teach you how to play it\n",
      "too.”\n",
      "Luke’s eyes go wide. “In front of everyone?”\n",
      "“Only if you want to.” She ruffles his hair, and my brain snags on\n",
      "everyone\n",
      ". Because Luke’s birthday is the one day of the year that Talia likes\n",
      "to crawl out of the woodwork.\n",
      "I glance over at my dad. We spent enough years working this land\n",
      "together, learned to read each other pretty well, and I see he’s thinking the\n",
      "same thing.\n",
      "I’ve never wanted to keep Talia away from Luke. I’ve given her every\n",
      "opportunity to be a part of his life, even if she hasn’t taken those chances.\n",
      "I think it hurts me more than it hurts Luke. For him, she’s not a factor.\n",
      "For me, she should have been. I can’t wrap my head around missing him\n",
      "growing up, but I’ll never shame her for it, and I’ll never gatekeep our son so\n",
      "long as she isn’t hurting him.\n",
      "“We need to talk about the reunion, Cade,” my dad says. “Come for\n",
      "lunch? You and I can do some planning.”\n",
      "“Willa too!” Luke is already dragging her up to the house, his tiny hand\n",

      "blur and desperately trying to keep it in place.\n",
      "She glances down at Luke and over at me. “It’s okay. I don’t need a day\n",
      "off from you, buddy. You’re one of my favorite people in the world.”\n",
      "My heart stutters in my chest, and I suck in a sharp breath. The way Luke\n",
      "smiles, the way he stands just a little bit taller, makes the bridge of my nose\n",
      "sting.\n",
      "I scrunch it up and give it a wipe before looking away. Then I stride to the\n",
      "house, head down, so no one will see the emotion in my eyes.\n",
      "But I don’t need to look at my dad for him to know. After all, who knows\n",
      "their son better than a single dad? Before he retired, we spent long days on\n",
      "the range together, so it’s damn near impossible to keep anything from each\n",
      "other. “You’ve got it bad, boy,” is what he says, clapping me on the shoulder as\n",

      "It’s charming, and symbolic, and it smells like wet flint, or the yard after a rainstorm.\n",
      "“Helloooo!” Luke pops his little face down into the opening, cackling\n",
      "when his greeting echoes back up at him.\n",
      "I sink to the ground, yanking him down with me. “Shush it, you little\n",
      "hellion. He’s going to hear us.”\n",
      "“Oh, yeah. Right.” Luke chortles more. Such a happy, goofy kid, even if\n",
      "his attention span leaves something to be desired.\n",
      "“Hey, Willa?”\n",
      "“Hey, Luke,” I reply dryly, since the \n",

      "I blink at the boy, too stunned to speak, so he continues. “At that birthday\n",
      "party? Where I got held under the water? He told me that even my mom\n",
      "didn’t like me.”\n",
      "I want to push that kid into the water all over again.\n",
      "“Well, I don’t just like you, Luke.” My voice comes out thick with\n",
      "emotion, but I’m not so sure he picks up on it. “I love you.”\n",
      "“You do?” His smile is shy—tentative.\n",
      "“Yeah. And that kid is a major shithead.”\n",
      "His hand slaps over his mouth and his eyes go wide before he whispers,\n",
      "“He’s a \n",
      "total\n",
      " shithead and I love you too.”\n",
      "I instantly pull him close, feeling his tiny body press against mine right\n",
      "where we’re kneeling on the ground.\n",
      "“Luke!” Cade’s voice is closer this time. “Willa! Why does it look like\n",
      "Valentine’s Day threw up all over the driveway?”\n",
      "I clap a hand over my mouth to hold in the laughter. Of course, that’s how\n",
      "Cade would see it. Fucking pessimist.\n",
      "“You two think you’re funny, don’t you?”\n",
      "I move my free hand to cover Luke’s mouth because he has no chill and\n",
      "is going to burst.\n",
      "Cade’s boots move off the paved part of the driveway, and I can hear\n",
      "them crunching against the packed gravel beside it, drawing closer.\n",
      "“The worst part is . . . when I find you, I’m going to punish you both.”\n",
      "Luke’s shoulders shake harder. He knows his dad is a big softy under that\n",
      "gruff exterior. I don’t think he’s punished Luke a day in his life.\n",
      "Me though? I’m not so sure. Bedroom Cade is not Dad Cade. My body\n",
      "tingles in response—I don’t laugh at all. “I bet you’re . . . behind the shed!” We can hear him jump and then groan\n",
      "when the spot he thought we’d be in is empty.\n",
      "I turn and give Luke a warning glare because I feel the little puffs of air\n",
      "escaping his lips. After I mouth, \n",
      "Be quiet\n",
      ", he gives me a nod and takes a\n",
      "breath in through his nose.\n",
      "Cade’s heavy footfalls draw nearer. “How about . . .” He’s approaching\n",
      "the well, but the opposite side. I give Luke a look and point upward, hoping\n",
      "he understands that we’re going to jump.\n",
      "He nods.\n",
      "My fingers count down from three.\n",
      "Two.\n",
      "One.\n",
      "“In the well!”\n",
      "We shoot up and shout, “Boo!”\n",
      "And predictably, Cade jumps, his tall frame startling as he takes a step\n",
      "back. His handsome face momentarily appears very shocked, and Luke and I\n",
      "dissolve into peals of laughter.\n",
      "“Gotcha,” I wheeze. “No wet T-shirt this time though!”\n",
      "“You should have seen your face!” Luke points at him.\n",
      "“Okay, that’s it. You’re both dead.” Cade points at us, spinning his cap\n",
      "backward and hitting me with a wink.\n",
      "Dick\n",
      ". He knows it kills me when he wears it like that. \n",
      "Murder me with\n",
      "your dick, please, sir.\n",
      "Luke turns and guns it for the main house. Cade lets him get a little ahead\n",
      "before his long strides eat up the ground behind him and he scoops Luke up\n",
      "into his arms and starts tickling him. Luke squirms and his light giggles blend\n",
      "with Cade’s deeper baritone.\n",
      "“Willa! Help!”\n",
      "“Don’t worry, Luke. I’m coming!” I sprint heroically around the well and\n",
      "get my fingers right up in Cade’s ribs.\n",
      "He squeals. He straight up \n",
      "squeals,\n",
      " and it is the least manly noise I’ve\n",
      "ever heard come out of such a manly man. We’re all laughing like lunatics,\n",
      "but Cade is stronger, taller, faster—meaner. And somehow, he tosses Luke\n",
      "over one shoulder and hefts me up over the other one.\n",
      "Luke slaps at his back in breathless hysterics. “Let me down!”\n",
      "Tossed over the opposite shoulder, I reach down farther and slap his ass,\n",
      "which just makes Luke laugh harder. “Giddy up, Daddy!” Luke calls, and Cade’s breath huffs out on my bare\n",
      "thigh.\n",
      "“You two are a pain in my ass.”\n",
      "“How the hell are you carrying us? This isn’t normal. Put me down.”\n",
      "“Woman. I can pick up calves, you two are nothing.” His finger traces the\n",
      "inside of my thigh, and I squirm.\n",
      "“Looks like you’ve got your hands full, son,” Harvey calls out, but I can’t\n",
      "see him. I don’t need to see him to hear the smile in his voice. “Why don’t I\n",
      "take the tiny hell-raiser off your hands for a bit longer?”\n",
      "“Yes! Save me, Grandpa!” Luke screams, thrashing wildly, shaking his\n",
      "dad’s body as he does.\n",
      "Cade grunts and sets Luke down instantly. “Good plan, Dad. Divide and\n",
      "conquer.”\n",
      "I hear Luke sprinting across the driveway away from us as I whisper,\n",
      "“Cade, put me down. I bet everyone can see my ass.”\n",
      "“They can’t,” he whispers back.\n",
      "“How do you know?”\n",
      "“Because I checked. I thought the view might be better than it is.\n",
      "Disappointing, to be honest.”\n",
      "“Dick. Let me down. I’m not a baby cow.”\n",
      "Cade just laughs.\n",
      "“You kids have fun!” Harvey calls, and it strikes me how blatantly\n",
      "obvious it must be that something is going on with us. “I drove past the other\n",
      "day and noticed your lawn. It could really use a good—”\n",
      "“Dad, just don’t,” Cade grumbles and marches over to his truck with me\n",
      "slung over his shoulder like a bag of feed. Or a baby cow.\n",
      "“Let’s go, Red. You’re with me today.” He claps my ass loudly to the\n",
      "delighted squeals of Luke and a bark of delighted surprise from his dad.\n",
      "Blood rushes to my cheeks and I cover my face with my hands. I tell\n",
      "myself it’s because I’m embarrassed, but deep down, I know it’s because this\n",
      "side of Cade is doing something to me.\n",
      "And that something is going to make leaving when this gig is up damn\n",
      "near impossible.\n",
      " “Why are we trail riding together on my day off?” I ask Cade from where I’m\n",
      "seated on a pretty dun ranch horse. It makes me miss Tux, but I know he’s fat\n",
      "and happy in a field right now, recuperating just fine. He’ll probably never\n",
      "want to jump another day in his life. He probably thinks he’s retired now.\n",
      "“Because I wanted to show you the land.”\n",
      "I eye Cade skeptically. Blueberry’s bobbing head is slung low, totally\n",
      "relaxed as we walk between the sparse bales of hay rolled up behind Cade’s\n",
      "house.\n",
      "“I’ve seen the land, Cade. I’m feeling pretty familiar with these hay bales\n",
      "too.”\n",
      "“It’s been a good year for hay,” is his stupid response. He’s all serious,\n",
      "shoulders held taut, hands propped on the horn of his saddle. Stupid hat still\n",
      "backward. “Plus, I feel relaxed out here on the land.”\n",
      "“You’re acting weird.” I give my gelding, Rocket, a little squeeze, urging\n",
      "him forward so I’m even with Cade. “Why are you acting weird?”\n",
      "“Can’t I just take you out on a romantic trail ride?”\n",
      "My lips roll together as I regard him. “You can. But you haven’t spoken a\n",
      "word to me since we got out of your truck. You look like you’re trying to\n",
      "disintegrate the leather in your hands, and your mouth keeps popping open\n",
      "like you’re about to say something, but then you shake your head and slam it\n",
      "back shut so hard your teeth clank. And I can hear you grinding said teeth\n",
      "until your mouth pops back open again.”\n",
      "He turns and gives me his annoyed scowl. “What are you? A shrink?”\n",
      "I hit him back with my best cheesy grin. “Nah. Just the daughter of one.”\n",
      "He huffs out a soft laugh and shakes his head, staring out over the flat\n",
      "expanse of land that looks like it shoots straight up into the Rockies. It’s\n",
      "beautiful—gold-green grass, gray rock, up to a blue-bird sky.\n",
      "“It’s Luke’s birthday next week. The little party we’re hosting is the\n",
      "following weekend. It’s casual. Just family.”\n",
      "I say nothing because I know where he’s going. He mentioned it once,\n",
      "and I never asked more questions because it wasn’t my business.\n",
      "“His mom always shows up for it.”\n",
      "“As she should,” I reply because it’s true. “Cade, this is really none of my\n",
      "business. If Luke is happy, I’m happy.”\n",
      "He sort of wobbles his head. “I’m not so sure that she makes Luke happy,\n",
      "to be honest. Nine out of ten times, it’s awkward. He doesn’t know how to\n",
      "act around her, and she sure as shit doesn’t know how to act around him. It’s not getting any better with age.”\n",
      "“Okay.” It’s all I can think to say. I don’t really know why he’s telling me\n",
      "all this.\n",
      "“I have a sinking suspicion it’s going to be more awkward with you\n",
      "there.”\n",
      "Stiffness permeates my neck as I shift to sit taller. “Are you saying you\n",
      "don’t want me there?”\n",
      "“No.” His response is quick and firm. I let out the breath I’d been holding\n",
      "back, ready to keep it together if he’d said yes. “Not at all. If you want to talk\n",
      "about something that would upset Luke—that would be it.”\n",
      "I nod, dropping my eyes to my fingers wrapped around the reins in my\n",
      "hands.\n",
      "“I want you there too,” Cade adds, and I can feel the weight of his gaze\n",
      "on my skin. “She might not like it, though, so I just want to prepare you for\n",
      "that.”\n",
      "My face scrunches as I turn to look at the man beside me. “Why would\n",
      "she not like me there? I’ll be there as his nanny.”\n",
      "His jaw works, and I watch his Adam’s apple bob when he swallows.\n",
      "“She’s . . . I don’t know.” He chuckles now, scrubbing a hand over his beard.\n",
      "“You know, I try so hard not to say bad things about her, because she’s half\n",
      "Luke and I love everything about that kid. But Willa, his mom is a fucking\n",
      "nightmare. I don’t know how my biggest mistake brought about my most\n",
      "cherished gift. But here I am.”\n",
      "“You’re so mature,” I quip. Because really, he is.\n",
      "He groans and stares up at the sky now. “Talia is oddly competitive. I was\n",
      "a trophy to her. But once she won me, she realized maybe it wasn’t the trophy\n",
      "she wanted. I can keep you and me under wraps because that will help keep\n",
      "her claws from coming out. But I can’t keep the way Luke loves you under\n",
      "wraps. And that’s going to bother her.”\n",
      "I sigh. Feeling way out of my depth with this sort of family dynamic.\n",
      "“Harvey is hyper-aware of it too. He’s not the biggest Talia fan. But he is\n",
      "a huge fan of you.”\n",
      "“Yeah, you did a great job of keeping us under wraps earlier,” I joke,\n",
      "thinking back on the way he carried me away like a caveman who just won\n",
      "the hunt.\n",
      "“Wasn’t trying to, Red. Don’t want to if I’m being honest.”\n",
      "I snort. “This is weird.” I see his lips tip up when he glances over at me. “Totally weird.”\n",
      "“But I’m not mad at it.”\n",
      "Cade tags on, “I might even be happy about it.”\n",
      "I squint my eyes at him—fuck, but he’s hot. It’s really just stupid. “Is that\n",
      "your happy scowl?”\n",
      "He shakes his head and snickers. “Can I tell Harvey that I’ve adequately\n",
      "prepared you for the party?”\n",
      "“Yeah, yeah. You don’t deal with a bunch of drunken idiots and catfights\n",
      "for years without learning a thing or two about handling shit like that. I’ll be\n",
      "fine. Let’s just keep it about Luke. Okay?”\n",
      "He nods, eyeing me like he’s checking me for any signs I’m stressed. And\n",
      "truthfully, I’m not. I’m not a drama seeker. In fact, I avoid it like the plague.\n",
      "If I have to smile and nod and fade into the background, then that’s what I’ll\n",
      "do.\n",
      "“Okay,” he agrees with a firm nod.\n",
      "“Okay. Good.” We stare at each other for a beat until a smile tugs up my\n",
      "cheeks as an idea to kill the tension pops into my head. “Last one to the\n",
      "mountains is a rotten egg!” bursts from my lips before I can stop it, and then\n",
      "I’m urging Rocket up into a canter, glancing over my shoulder at Cade,\n",
      "who’s grinning at me like I’m a psycho.\n",
      "“Git up!” he calls to Blueberry, and her hooves pound behind me.\n",
      "I lean forward in the tack, coming off Rocket’s back to give him some\n",
      "space to gallop, pushing my hands up his neck and giving him slack in the\n",
      "reins. He stretches out, and when I glance back again, Cade isn’t gaining on\n",
      "me like I thought he would.\n",
      "“You scared, Eaton?” I shout.\n",
      "“No, baby. Just enjoying the view. Your ass looks mighty fine from back\n",
      "here.”\n",
      "We both laugh and joy bubbles in my chest. I don’t let up though. He can\n",
      "stare at my ass, but I’m still going to kick his.\n",
      "“Thank you!” I shout back as a joke. But deep down, it doesn’t feel like a\n",
      "joke.\n",
      "It feels like he’s wiggling his way into my heart. 26 C\n",
      "Willa\n",
      "Summer:\n",
      " I feel like we live on the same piece of land and yet, I haven’t seen\n",

      "me.\n",
      "“Hi,” is all I say from the far side of the hot tub, steam wafting around\n",
      "me. We’re well into the dog days of summer now. It’s August and the nights\n",
      "have cooled. The air is fresh against my chest and shoulders, but the hot\n",
      "bubbling water caresses my body, chasing away the chill.\n",
      "I’m not cold at all. Especially watching Cade step onto the patio, barefoot\n",
      "with thin lounge pants slung low, signature black T-shirt hugging his biceps,\n",
      "and hair all mussed from a shower and lying down with Luke. “Luke asleep?”\n",
      "“Yeah.” His eyes rake over me hungrily. “I meant to come find you\n",
      "sooner, but I think I fell asleep in there.”\n",
      "“That’s okay. I’ve been keeping busy,” I reply, not missing the way his\n",
      "head quirks and his eyes narrow.\n",
      "“Yeah? Busy with what?”\n",
      "“Thinking about last night,” I reply boldly, stretching my arms above my\n",
      "head and showing him the way my nipples have pebbled beneath my thin,\n",
      "purple bathing suit.\n",
      "The same one he couldn’t take his eyes off of the last time we found\n",
      "ourselves in here together.\n",
      "Rather than approaching me, he props a shoulder against a thick wooden\n",
      "beam, still standing under the covered portion of the patio. He crosses his\n",
      "arms over his chest and regards me like he’s unaffected. However, when my\n",
      "eyes drop below his waistline, I know that’s not true.\n",
      "“What part?” His voice is a rumble, thunder that rolls over my skin and\n",
      "shoots straight to my core.\n",
      "“Well, I started out thinking about how I got on my knees for you.”\n",
      "“You do look beautiful on your knees,” he replies smoothly. My heart\n",
      "rate ratchets up under his gaze. Recounting last night has every nerve ending\n",
      "firing. “More beautiful when you struggle to take it all. I love watching you\n",
      "work so hard.”\n",
      "A smile twists my mouth.\n",
      "“Pull the bathing suit down, Red. Let me see those perfect tits.”\n",
      "My thumbs hook under the straps as I lick my lips and swallow against\n",
      "the dryness in my throat. Peeling the wet nylon back, I hold his gaze. It burns\n",
      "like hot coals, following my every movement.\n",
      "“Good. Now, play with your nipples while you tell me more about last\n",
      "night.”\n",
      "He doesn’t move an inch, and I try to gather courage to keep going\n",
      "because, while I’ve had some good sex in my life, I’ve had nothing like this.\n",
      "Or anyone like Cade.\n",
      "My forefingers and thumbs twist my nipples, and it makes my voice go\n",
      "all breathy when I say, “I liked when you came after me. I’m sorry I stormed\n",
      "off before you could finish talking.”\n",
      "He blinks at me, like he’s a little surprised by what I just told him. “You\n",
      "don’t need to apologize, Red. I haven’t exactly sent clear signals with you.” Pinch. Roll. Swipe. The truth tumbles out.\n",
      "“Neither have I.”\n",
      "His jaw shifts. “No one would expect you to be the mature one in this\n",
      "relationship when I’m the one who’s in his late thirties.”\n",
      "I tip my nose up, refusing to let that comment make me feel childish or\n",
      "young. Cade isn’t looking at me that way, so I push the thought away,\n",
      "focusing on another word he used.\n",
      "My hands smooth over the fullness of my breasts, and he watches, eyes\n",
      "glued to me, his length straining hard at his pants. “Is that what this is? A\n",
      "relationship?”\n",
      "I realize I want him to say yes—take control of how out of control I’m\n",
      "feeling around him—and tell me how this is going to work. Because I want\n",
      "something to work.\n",
      "But he says, “It’s whatever you’re comfortable with, Red. We can let it be\n",
      "gradual. We can skip a label. We can figure it out when the time comes. But\n",
      "whatever it is, it’s important to me. \n",
      "You’re \n",
      "important to me.”\n",

      "I’ve flitted around doing whatever I want for years with no real tether to\n",
      "anything except my best friend and my brother. I’ve enjoyed seeing his career\n",
      "take off, but none of that was for me.\n",
      "I feel grounded out here. At this house. With Cade and Luke. It’s\n",
      "happened slowly, but I feel like I belong here, which seems absolutely insane\n",
      "to blurt out to this man who just very clearly reiterated our age difference or\n",
      "pointed to my maturity as a reason for my behavior.\n",
      "And he’s not wrong. I’ve always been a little averse to growing up and\n",
      "settling down, but I’m finding I want nothing more. After so much time\n",
      "spinning around not knowing what I want, I think I might have finally figured\n",
      "it out.\n",
      "“You’re important to me too, Cade,” is what I settle on, because I know\n",
      "he needs to hear that. He’s homed in on my insecurities, and I’ve homed in\n",
      "on his.\n",
      "We build each other up. We tidy one another’s loose ends. We fit so\n",
      "perfectly.\n",
      "“Good. But, Red, I don’t think I told you to stop playing with those tits.”\n",
      "His voice changes, taking on a playful edge as he takes long, casual steps toward the hot tub, peeling his shirt away and dropping it on the brick patio.\n",
      "“Yeah, but now you’re standing out there looking like a total snack, and I\n",
      "want you to come play with them instead,” I pout dramatically while my\n",

      "by the way he’s looking at me. “Your cock in my mouth. Hard boards biting\n",

      "together? I loved it.”\n",
      "His jaw pops under the strain of holding himself back. I can see the\n",

      "shoulders.” His eyes trail over me. “Tits out and heaving. Begging to be\n",

      "are reverent at the same time. So full of admiration. Possession.\n",
      "“Stop fucking around and show me how pretty you look with your fingers\n",
      "shoved inside, baby.” His voice sounds strangled as he moves his eyes to mine. There’s something on his face I can’t quite place. A vulnerability that\n",
      "pops up only now and then.\n",
      "A look that says he needs me as badly as I need him. In one smooth\n",
      "movement, I slide one finger in, then two. But he doesn’t watch between my\n",
      "legs, his eyes stay on my face. A blush rushes over my cheeks.\n",
      "This should feel dirty, a bit playful, but it feels like worship and he’s not\n",

      "cover by saying, “What about pretty? I get that a lot.” Because I’m not sure\n",
      "incredible \n",
      "has ever really happened.\n",
      "He shakes his head before stepping into the hot tub, still wearing those\n",
      "lounge pants that skim his body so deliciously.\n",
      "He drops into the water, toned arms gliding him across to me in one\n",
      "smooth movement. “You’re still weari—”\n",
      "“No. Pretty girls don’t make me feel like this.” His hand wraps around\n",
      "my calf while the other comes to hold my hand between my legs. He takes\n",
      "control of that hand, making me pump in and out of myself a couple of times.\n",
      "“Like what?” I breathe, head tilted down, eyes fixed on the man\n",
      "submerged between my legs.\n",
      "“Totally out of control.”\n",
      "And then he drops his mouth to me. My head tips back, and he makes me\n",
      "feel totally out of control too.\n",
      "He sucks at my clit. Licks at my lips. Hums like he loves the taste. All\n",
      "while still working my hand with his.\n",
      "“Keep going, baby,” is all he says when he draws his hand away to grip\n",

      "while Cade Eaton lays me out and makes a meal of me.\n",

      "water—proof that he couldn’t hold himself back even a second longer—that\n",
      "has me barreling quickly toward that cliff.\n",
      "The same one he’s been pushing me off for about the last twenty-four\n",
      "hours. The one he’s always at the bottom of to catch me when I fall.\n",
      "And fall I do.\n",
      "With my fingers thrusting in and out easily, and his expert tongue\n",
      "working me, I bite out, “Cade! Fuck!” All that tingly pressure inside me\n",
      "explodes. Down my inner thighs. Up my spine.\n",
      "Straight to my heart.\n",
      "His hands are all over me, pulling me into the water, sliding over me\n",
      "possessively. My ass, my ribs, fingers trailing up the column of my spine,\n",
      "until he holds me close and whispers in my ear, “Fucking incredible.”\n",
      "I turn and kiss his stubbled cheek, seeing the corner of his mouth lift. But\n",
      "I don’t get to see the small smile for long because he’s turning us, putting me\n",
      "down in the water while he pushes to stand above me.\n",
      "He pushes the wet fabric down, letting his thick, proud cock jut up\n",
      "between us.\n",
      "I lick my lips and he smirks. “No, baby. First, I’m fucking those pretty\n",
      "tits, then you can have a taste.”\n",
      "“Okay, deal,” I reply as I quickly draw closer.\n",
      "A laugh rumbles in his chest. “So eager. I’ll add that to your list of\n",
      "admirable traits. Now put my cock between your breasts and push them\n",
      "together. It’s my turn now.”\n",
      "“You like to watch, huh, Eaton?” I tease while doing as he told me.\n",
      "“I like to watch you, Red.”\n",
      "I shake my head, like it might ward away the butterflies erupting in my\n",
      "stomach. I’ve never done this before, and it’s exciting—his cock on my chest,\n",
      "breasts pushed tightly around his girth, a drop of white glistening on his thick\n",
      "head. I glance up at him and smile. His tongue darts out over his bottom lip,\n",
      "and then both lips flatten in concentration. Arms slung back behind himself,\n",
      "he thrusts. The water lubricates us, and his movements are slow and\n",
      "measured.\n",
      "His mouth is slightly open, chiseled cheeks slack as he watches himself\n",
      "sliding between my breasts. We don’t talk. I think we’re both in a bit of a\n",
      "trance—or maybe we’ve said enough tonight.\n",
      "Maybe he’s feeling just as exposed as I am.\n",
      "Maybe if I feel like a goddess when we’re together, he feels like a god.\n",
      "Maybe we both just revel in that feeling.\n",
      "My arousal hasn’t abated and watching him slide his cock through my tits\n",
      "is getting me worked up all over again. Every time he murmurs, “Fuck,” in that deep breathy voice, my pussy clenches.\n",
      "“Willa, I’m going to come.”\n",
      "“Yes,” I hiss, biting at my lip, propping my chest in the most inviting\n",
      "angle, loving watching him come apart for me.\n",
      "And then I feel it. Cade goes still and his cock throbs and twitches. His\n",
      "cum shoots out over my chest. One shot hits my chin, and he groans, which\n",
      "turns to a quiet sigh as his hand strokes the back of my head.\n",
      "I rise and stand before him, dripping with his seed. “That was fun.”\n",
      "Cade huffs out a deep, appreciative chuckle. “God, was it ever.” And then\n",
      "his eyes are burning over me, assessing his handy work.\n",
      "“How do I look?” I quirk a brow and arch my back.\n",
      "“Like you’re mine,” he growls.\n",
      "Those words. My body aches for more. I want him to be mine too.\n",
      "“Yeah? You like this look on me?”\n",
      "“It would be better like this.” He swipes his thumb over my chin and in\n",
      "one smooth movement, paints my lips with the stray shot of cum. He leans\n",
      "back and looks at me with a mischievous grin on his face. “Definitely mine.”\n",
      "“You’re a savage, Eaton.” I laugh lightly, before darting my tongue out to\n",
      "taste what he put there. “And I love it.”\n",
      "“Good thing, Red.” He slips into the water, dragging me down with him\n",
      "to wash us off. “Because I’m going to haul your fine ass to my cave now.\n",
      "Keep you on your back, coming all night long.”\n",
      "Then he scoops me up and carries me into the house.\n",
      "Like a total savage.\n",
      "One that keeps me coming all night long. 27 “Y\n",

      "Cade:\n",
      " That’s fine. Luke won’t care.\n",

      " So did every other guy in town.\n",
      "Talia:\n",
      " Fuck you.\n",
      "ou’re acting weird.” I glance down at Summer, who is staring out\n",
      "over the back field, assessing it like it’s the Met Gala or something.\n",
      "She and Willa have been up since early this morning setting Luke’s\n",
      "party up in the hayfield, per his request.\n",
      "There’s a bouncy castle and a tent with some weird fucking guy in head- to-toe khaki sitting under it who apparently brought snakes and lizards to\n",
      "show the kids. There’s another tent with a buffet-style table covered in things\n",
      "Willa has been baking for days. I know because I tested the icing by swiping\n",
      "it on her neck and licking it off.\n",
      "It was fucking delicious.\n",
      "She’s got lemonade with lemons and strawberries floating in it. It’s\n",
      "adorable. She’s got little plates with poop emojis on them that Luke picked\n",
      "out with her. The tablecloths match. Only Willa could take shit plates and\n",
      "somehow tie them into a beautiful outdoor birthday party for a six-year-old.\n",
      "I wouldn’t have even let him get them, but she just laughed and tossed\n",
      "them in the basket. “Excellent choice!” she said, and Luke \n",
      "beamed\n",
      ".\n",
      "“Yeah. I know,” I finally reply to Summer. Because I am acting weird.\n",
      "Willa and I have been sneaking around for a couple of weeks, and I don’t\n",
      "want to sneak anymore. I’m trying hard not to scare the shit out of her by\n",
      "being so sure about everything. But the fact of the matter is, I \n",
      "am \n",
      "sure.\n",
      "I’ve made my mistakes. I’ve lived with the fallouts. I’ve spent years\n",
      "thinking about my life and what it would take for me to give someone a\n",
      "chance again.\n",
      "And watching this woman plan what I meant to be a simple backyard\n",
      "barbecue for a kid and instead treating it like it’s the celebration of the\n",
      "century is just the cherry on top.\n",
      "It feels fast, and yet it doesn’t. I wouldn’t have given in to this if it didn’t\n",
      "feel right.\n",
      "“Cade Eaton.” Summer’s dark eyes are sparkling at me right now, and her\n",
      "jaw drops as she scans my face. Sharp as a tack, this one. I told Rhett once\n",
      "that I loved her because she was good for him but hated that she was smarter\n",
      "than me.\n",
      "And this moment does nothing but prove that statement.\n",
      "“You’re in love with my best friend, aren’t you?”\n",
      "I cross my arms over my chest and look away. \n",
      "Love\n",
      ". I was never sure I\n",
      "could love someone in the way everyone talks about it. My heart has taken\n",
      "too many shit-kickings over the years. My mom. Talia. What Talia meant for\n",
      "the course my life took. All the things I missed out on, which I hate to even\n",
      "mention because I have Luke. But I’d be a liar if I said I never thought about\n",
      "what I might have done differently had life dealt me a different hand.\n",
      "Maybe I’d be rodeoing. Or traveling all over North America, rolling in\n",
      "the cash that comes from selling top-of-the-line horses. Maybe I’d be training all day and riding buckle bunnies all night.\n",
      "All those maybes. But as I watch Willa put little weighted clips on the\n",
      "tablecloth so nothing blows away, I know that none of those maybes would\n",
      "have been right.\n",
      "The hand dealt to me is what brought her to my front step.\n",
      "“Yeah,” I grumble, still refusing to look at Summer.\n",
      "She makes a satisfied little humming noise, and when I peek out of the\n",
      "corner of my eye at her, she winks and gives me a side hug. She’s so tiny that\n",
      "it’s awkward. She doesn’t have Willa’s height or long limbs.\n",
      "“You should tell her.”\n",
      "“Tell her?”\n",
      "She shrugs. “Yeah. I think Willa would want to know that.”\n",
      "I snort. “So that I can scare her away?”\n",
      "Her lips curve up slowly. “I don’t think you’ll be able to scare Willa\n",
      "away,” is all she says before giving me another squeeze and walking in the\n",
      "opposite direction.\n",
      "She drops a truth bomb casually and then just leaves me to overanalyze\n",
      "the hell out of it.\n",
      "The party is already in full swing by the time Talia deigns to bless us with her\n",
      "presence. I don’t even have to turn to see her because I hear, “My baaabyyy!”\n",
      "in her high, sugary voice.\n",
      "Her baby\n",
      ". I can’t even stop my eyes from rolling up to the sky when I\n",
      "hear it. It’s a ridiculous thing to say to a child you see once a year and walked\n",
      "away from without a goodbye.\n",
      "I catch sight of Willa talking to my dad and some of the other parents.\n",
      "She’s wearing an orange dress with little white polka dots and a soft flowing\n",
      "skirt. I want to flip it up and see what’s underneath.\n",
      "But now, watching the way she stiffens and her fingers crinkle in on the\n",
      "poop emoji cup she’s holding, I want to throw my arm around her shoulder\n",
      "and reassure her. I want to make her cheeks pink again because they’re going\n",
      "pale right before my eyes.\n",
      "She wouldn’t want me to though. She’s too fierce, too proud. So I look\n",
      "away, because if I stay eyeing her, I’m going to do it anyway. Luke gives Talia a stiff hug, kind of patting her on her slender back as she\n",
      "mauls him. I wish she wouldn’t waltz into his party late, when she wanted it\n",
      "earlier, and still make it all about her.\n",
      "If nothing else, it’s very on brand for her.\n",
      "“Let me see you.” She’s dressed to the nines in a skin-tight dress and high\n",
      "heels that are sinking into the grass as she assesses him. “How did you grow\n",
      "up so fast?”\n",
      "I hear Rhett snort.\n",
      "Loud.\n",
      "Loud enough that she turns a venomous glare at him.\n",
      "He just smiles back. “Hi, Talia. Long time no see.”\n",
      "Fucking shit disturber. I always bite my tongue about her around Luke\n",
      "because I want him to make his own decisions about his mother. If he wants a\n",
      "relationship with her one day, I don’t want him thinking I poisoned him\n",
      "against her. It kills me but I know it’s right.\n",
      "Which is why I bite back my laugh at her brittle smile and the way her\n",
      "eyes pinch. She’s like this beautiful mirage on the outside, all sour on the\n",
      "inside. And if looks could kill, Rhett would keel over on the spot.\n",
      "Luckily, that’s not the case, and he raises his poop emoji cup toward her\n",
      "in a silent cheers.\n",
      "Behind me I hear a snicker that sounds distinctly like my dad. I don’t\n",
      "turn, though, because Luke is looking so uncomfortable with everyone\n",
      "watching that all I can think about is getting to him.\n",
      "“Hi, Talia.” I interrupt the awkward moment by striding forward with my\n",
      "hand out to shake hers as I give Luke’s shoulder a firm squeeze.\n",
      "“Oh please, Cade. Are we so far gone that we need to shake hands?” Her\n",
      "giggle trills and grates on my nerves. It doesn’t sound like wind chimes the\n",
      "way Willa’s did that day in Le Pamplemousse or the way it does when I step\n",
      "into the house after a long, hard day at work. And Luke’s doesn’t blend in\n",
      "with it at all.\n",
      "Luke stands there awkwardly, most likely hitting the age where he’s\n",
      "piecing these things together, noting the body language and drawing his own\n",
      "conclusions.\n",
      "I stand woodenly while Talia wraps her arms around me. One hand rubs\n",
      "up the back of my neck, and I instantly reach up and grip her elbow, pulling\n",
      "her arm away, even as she sneaks a kiss against my cheek.\n",
      "“Oh gosh”—she laughs—“let me get that for you.” And then she’s standing close to me, licking her thumb and rubbing at my cheek, trying to\n",
      "get the thick layer of lipstick off my skin.\n",
      "Marking her territory.\n",
      "It’s been years and Talia hasn’t changed a bit. She’s always playing some\n",
      "game. The difference is that now I see it. I didn’t all those years ago. I saw a\n",
      "pretty package and a willing body.\n",
      "I was horny and stupid, and she was calculated.\n",
      "“It’s fine. I’ll get it.” I step away as the surrounding conversation picks\n",
      "back up, which somehow makes me feel better. Like our complicated little\n",
      "family isn’t the center of attention. I desperately want to turn around and\n",
      "check on Willa, but I also know Talia will pick up on it immediately.\n",
      "And I’m not subjecting Willa to her shit. Not until things with her and me\n",
      "are solid. Official.\n",
      "I should have made things official already. I’m kicking myself now. The\n",
      "pads of my fingers itch to touch her, to run over her neck reassuringly.\n",
      "Possessively.\n",
      "“Gosh, Cade. You’re like a good scotch. You just keep getting better with\n",
      "age.” Talia reaches out to run her French-tipped fingers over my shoulder,\n",
      "like she has some sort of right to touch me. Like she’s forgotten our text\n",
      "exchange earlier this week. She was always forward, and maybe she’s always\n",
      "been like this when she shows up once a year.\n",
      "Maybe it just didn’t bother me before now.\n",
      "All the same, I take another step back, pulling Luke in front of me and\n",
      "putting both my hands on his shoulders. “How have you been?”\n",
      "“Good.” She glances around the space in the field. “You know, living in\n",

      "It didn’t.\n",
      "“In Calgary?” Luke asks brightly.\n",
      "“Yes, honey.” She looks down at him with a big smile. “Handsome like\n",
      "your daddy, but with Mom’s blue eyes.”\n",
      "“My nanny is from Calgary!” is Luke’s response.\n",
      "“A nanny! How adorable.” She bends down to see eye to eye with Luke.\n",
      "“Is she here today? I’d love to meet her.”\n",
      "Before I can interject, Luke tears away. I can’t blame him for wanting to be close to Willa. She’s a comfort to him, where this other woman who lives\n",

      "really,” I reply while avoiding Summer’s eyes. Because the last time I looked\n",
      "at her, she held her hands up beside her head and made little devil horns with\n",

      "right about now.\n",

      "someone ugly to make me feel better about myself. I’d even settle for average\n",
      "looking, but no, she’s a ten. An eleven.\n",
      "“I don’t know what you mean,” I clarify. “I love living out here. Your son\n",

      "really to say? You know? But he was still boring. He married me like it was\n",
      "ticking a line off a to-do list. I mean, sure, his dick is big, but that can only\n",
      "make up for so much. You’ll see. Robbing the cradle will eat away at his\n",

      "Another drawer. No corkscrew. I spin on Cade, who is giving me his full\n",

      "“I could really use that drink now,” I say, still staring at him.\n",

      "all entitled, and I’m so jealous that my teeth ache with it. I have never, \n",
      "never\n",
      "felt like this, and I want it to stop.” The last part comes out pleading, like he\n",

      "“You did but—”\n",
      "“If you can’t stop running your mouth with that self-sabotaging bullshit, I\n",

      "love Luke. And the three of us feel \n",
      "right \n",
      "together. Tonight she’ll be gone and\n",
      "you’ll still be here. At the end of this summer, you’ll leave, but you’ll be\n",

      "We’re going to figure this out. You got me?”\n",
      "I swallow hard, searching his dark, serious eyes, his furrowed brow, the\n",
      "look of intensity on his face. The little voice in my head says he’s joking, but\n",
      "I know Cade well enough to know he wouldn’t joke about this.\n",
      "“But—”\n",
      "In the blink of an eye, he’s adjusted his grip to pop open my jaw and\n",
      "stuffs my panties inside. My irises widen as he works the fabric in and I stand\n",
      "stock still, too shocked to stop him. Too turned on to want to.\n",
      "“There are no buts about it, Red. Now get your palms flat on the counter\n",
      "and bend over.”\n",
      "I still stare at him wide-eyed, a little shocked by how quickly this conversation has flipped. With a gentle hand on my shoulder, he turns me\n",
      "away, and I let my hands slide across the bare countertop.\n",
      "“That’s my girl,” he murmurs, pushing down between my shoulder blades\n",
      "so that my torso presses against the counter, the edge of the cool marble\n",
      "biting into my hips. “Teasing me with this dress all afternoon. The only thing\n",
      "I can think about is bending you over and checking what you’re wearing\n",
      "underneath.”\n",
      "I moan against the fabric in my mouth, hips shimmying as I arch my back\n",
      "in a silent invitation for him to check.\n",
      "“Should I check?” His calloused fingers run up the back of my thighs,\n",
      "taking the hem of my favorite dress with them as they go. Goose bumps erupt\n",
      "across my back, and I hear his breath hitch when the soft fabric clears my\n",
      "bare ass and bunches at the base of my back. “Filthy girl. Walking around out\n",
      "there with no panties. You were hoping I’d check, weren’t you?”\n",
      "I press my cheek flat against the cool marble and look back at him, his\n",
      "eyes fixed on my ass. I nod. Because yeah, I wanted him to check. Wanted\n",
      "him to haul me into the bathroom and fuck me against the wall. Fuck the\n",
      "nerves right out of me.\n",
      "But I’m here, bared to him in the open of his kitchen with a party\n",
      "happening only a few hundred meters away.\n",
      "His hands massage the globes of my ass, and I lift my head to see out the\n",
      "window and check if anyone might be coming.\n",
      "“What are you looking for, baby? You think I’d stop just because\n",
      "someone walked in?” His fingers glide down between my legs, and he runs\n",
      "two gentle fingers through my wet folds. “Maybe Talia will catch us, and I\n",
      "can make things abundantly clear for both of you. Because I can promise you,\n",
      "I’ve never fucked anyone the way I fuck you.” I clench and moan.\n",
      "“You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” His voice is all gravel. “I wouldn’t care.\n",
      "You’re \n",
      "mine\n",
      ", Willa. And I don’t give a fuck who knows it.”\n",
      "His fingers slide in, smooth and slow. One hand presses down on my\n",
      "back as he leans forward to whisper, “Is that what you need? You need me to\n",
      "bend you over right here and now, then send you back out there dripping my\n",
      "cum down your pretty little thighs to prove it to you?”\n",
      "My mind races. Fuck. Is that what I want? I barely need to think about it.\n",
      "I want that so badly I ache with it. The pads of my fingers slide on the\n",
      "counter as I glance over my shoulder and nod.\n",
      "“Good,” he bites out, scrambling with his belt. “Because I want that too.” Within seconds he’s dropped his pants and impaled me on his cock. And\n",
      "there’s nothing soft about it. My body clamps around his steely length the\n",
      "minute he shoves himself into me.\n",
      "One of his big hands wraps around my hip while the other presses down\n",
      "on my back, holding me in place.\n",
      "“You look so good on my cock, Willa,” he growls as his thighs slap\n",
      "against mine, and I arch myself up, pushing back at his every thrust, feeling\n",
      "just as wild and unhinged as him in this moment.\n",
      "Like he can read my mind, he leans over my back and grits out, “You\n",
      "want it all, Willa? The house? The babies? The ranch?”\n",
      "I nod again because it’s all I can do. I want all that. With him.\n",
      "“You want me, Willa?”\n",
      "“Yes.” I cry out against the soft fabric, nodding frantically as he slams\n",
      "into me. I want him so badly it hurts.\n",
      "“Good. Because I’m sick of holding back with you. You’re not going\n",
      "anywhere. You belong here, with me.”\n",
      "He lifts me, arm wrapped around my stomach as he clutches me to his\n",
      "chest. His stubble rasps against the shell of my ear. “Rub your clit while I’m\n",
      "fucking you. Let me tell you how it’s going to be.”\n",
      "My head falls back against his shoulder as one hand gathers the fabric of\n",
      "my skirt. The opposite one immediately dives between my legs and rubs\n",
      "circles while Cade holds me tight.\n",
      "“You’re going to spend as much time as you want at \n",
      "our \n",
      "house,” he says,\n",
      "while thrusting into me slowly. “You’re going to work whatever job you\n",
      "want. Wherever you want. But you’ll always have a place here. A home here.\n",
      "I’ll make you coffee every morning. I’ll leave you all the Post-it notes you\n",
      "want. I’ll cook your dinner every day. I’ll eat your pussy in the hot tub before\n",
      "bed every damn night.”\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "I whimper, almost sagging in relief at his confession. I didn’t even realize\n",
      "how badly I needed to hear that he wants me. For more than just a few weeks.\n",
      "His voice is firm and then he stops, pressing a stubbled kiss to my\n",
      "exposed neck while his hands roam my breasts and I focus on breathing\n",
      "through my nose.\n",
      "“But this pussy is \n",
      "mine, \n",
      "Willa.” He drags his lips over my skin until I\n",
      "can’t even think straight. I press harder on my clit, feeling myself barrel\n",
      "toward that finish line. “Mine to fuck.” Yes.\n",
      "I rub back on him as he holds me close. Every sensation magnified, more\n",
      "intense somehow. The scrape of his beard. The pressure of my fingers. The\n",
      "light-headedness seeping in.\n",
      "My teeth bare down on the fabric in my mouth.\n",
      "I shake in his hold.\n",
      "“Mine to fill.”\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "With that he pushes me onto the counter and unleashes, right as my vision\n",
      "blurs and I convulse, crying out his muffled name. My entire body surges\n",
      "with fire as I come apart beneath him.\n",
      "We’re just energy, and heat, and breath. I’ve never been so thoroughly\n",
      "consumed in my life. Never had sex with such an edge to it.\n",
      "“\n",
      "Mine\n",
      ".” His growl is downright feral as he explodes inside of me, hands\n",
      "tracing my back reverently. A man of such dichotomies. Hard words laced\n",
      "with love. Rough hands filled with tenderness.\n",
      "Immediately, he reaches up and removes the fabric from my mouth. I\n",
      "pant and suck in air, which has more to do with the power of my orgasm than\n",
      "the gag he fashioned for me. His breaths are heavy and uneven, our skin is\n",
      "damp.\n",
      "And even though I don’t think I can get any hotter than I already am,\n",
      "when he pulls away and puts one hand on each globe of my ass to watch me\n",
      "drip his seed, I do.\n",
      "When he adds, “Just like that,” I press my forehead to the cool marble\n",
      "and let a quiet, breathy chuckle escape me.\n",
      "“Jesus.”\n",
      "With a firm slap, he huffs out a laugh, and it’s like I can still feel his eyes\n",
      "on the most intimate parts of me. I clearly have no shame because I make no\n",
      "move to stand. “Have I told you that you look perfect like this?”\n",
      "I roll my forehead against the marble counter, still trying to get my\n",
      "bearings. “No. I think that’s a first for me.”\n",
      "A satisfied noise rumbles from behind me, and I feel the soft slide of\n",
      "fabric covering my legs, followed by the gentle press of a kiss against my\n",
      "back. “Feeling better now?” Cade asks, pulling me up gently, hands never\n",
      "leaving my body as he turns me to face him.\n",
      "“I’m feeling something alright.” I smile a little shyly at him. I mean, how\n",
      "can I not? The things that come out of this man’s mouth are downright shocking sometimes.\n",
      "He eyes me skeptically, tracing my face with his gaze.\n",
      "“I’m feeling better. Just . . . messy?” I glance down at myself. “I’ll just go\n",
      "clean up.” I reach out to swipe my discarded panties off the counter, but he\n",
      "grabs them first.\n",
      "He gives me this evil smirk. A playful smirk? Maybe it’s a playful scowl?\n",
      "But it’s followed by, “No chance. You’re putting these on, and you’re going\n",
      "back out there like this.”\n",
      "I shake my head at him, amused, as he drops to the ground and lifts my\n",
      "feet gently into the leg holes of the simple underwear. He presses a soft kiss\n",
      "to my stomach and then he’s up, moving around the kitchen, like this is all\n",
      "the most normal thing in the world. When I stop blushing enough to face him\n",

      "My mouth opens and closes, and I peek over at Cade for some sort of sign\n",
      "that I’m not out of line in saying something here. His gloved hands are slung\n",

      "He’s fucking lickable.\n",
      "Too good to leave behind, that’s for sure.\n",

      "again.\n",
      "“Cool, cool. Me too,” I say, giving him an exaggerated watery wink.\n",
      "“How was brunch?” He digs again, arms flexing as he does.\n",
      "I never knew a man digging out a spot for a sidewalk could be an\n",
      "aphrodisiac, but here I am, admiring the way his shoulders bulge against his\n",
      "T-shirt and the tendons in his forearms ripple in the sunlight.\n",
      "“Good.”\n",

      "“Yup,” is his gruff response.\n",

      "impersonation.\n",

      "to be made a fool of again.”\n",

      "“Cade, look at me.”\n",
      "His jaw clenches, but he doesn’t look my way, opting to stare down at the\n",

      "“Trying to get your attention.” I stretch my legs out in front of me and\n",
      "lean back on my palms, feeling the cool damp dirt beneath them. It smells\n",
      "like earth, and flint, and pine needles. It smells like home.\n",
      "“You’ve had my attention since—”\n",
      "I roll my eyes and wave a hand at him. “Yeah, yeah. Since I dropped my\n",
      "panties at your feet.”\n",
      "“No. Since I first heard you laugh.”\n",
      "That shuts me up.\n",
      "“In the coffee shop. I was standing behind you and couldn’t stop thinking\n",
      "about how incredible your laugh was. All fucking light and warm. It made me\n",
      "want to laugh too.”\n",
      "My tongue darts out over my lips as I regard him.\n",

      "won’t be enough for you and you’ll walk away. And I’ll be stuck here in the\n",

      "“And what? Pretend we haven’t been living together for almost two\n",
      "months already? Should I go live up at the main house with Harvey?”\n",
      "He doesn’t even flinch. “That might give us a chance to date properly.\n",
      "Maybe a little distance is good for you to be sure about everything. Or we\n",
      "could commute.”\n",
      "I roll my eyes and cross my feet. “Shut up, Cade. Stop being so mature.”\n",
      "“Someone has to be,” he grumbles, tossing another shovelful of dirt over\n",
      "his shoulder and looking mighty sexy as he does it.\n",
      "“Hey, you know what this yard needs?” I press my index finger to my lips\n",
      "as I make a show of examining the property.\n",
      "“What?”\n",
      "“A real good blow job.”\n",

      "with my broken fingers.\n",
      "“Okay, champ. Off to the hospital we go.” Willa slides her hand around\n",

      "“Yes.” Her lips thin, and her heels click against the floor as she shuts the\n",

      "from what I can see on the X-rays, there are some bone chips floating in\n",
      "there. We could do a surgical repair—”\n",
      "“I don’t—”\n",

      "“Like I was saying, we could operate and tidy things up immediately, but\n",
      "my inclination is to avoid surgery when possible. So the other option is to\n",
      "splint these and let them heal. Hope those chips sort of dissolve on their own\n",
      "and see how you feel. If they’re still causing issues, we can operate down the\n",

      "without meeting my eyes, she steps into my arms.\n",
      "She sighs when she does, and so do I. It’s amazing how the adults around\n",
      "you can fuck everything up. That’s what happened with Summer and Winter\n",

      "I was also there in the hospital, sitting by Summer’s bedside, when\n",

      "room staring into space.\n",
      "Winter stayed for a while. She wasn’t overly comforting, but it was nice\n",
      "to have someone with me all the same. She was quiet and withdrawn as soon\n",
      "as the test came back positive.\n",

      "beautifully crafted face. I’m not even mad, I’m not even sad. I’m oddly at\n",
      "peace with the whole thing.\n",

      "Just tell me how to be supportive.”\n",
      "Fuck, he’s sweet. His voice is all rough edges and deep grumbles, but I\n",
      "know he means what he says.\n",
      "I just worry that after being trapped by one pregnancy, he’ll feel the same\n",
      "all over again. He’ll feel confined. He’ll be stuck providing for a woman and\n",
      "a baby that he never really got to be sure he wanted.\n",
      "Again.\n",
      "“No,” I reply softly, “Winter was great. I’m hoping her and Summer can\n",
      "mend this thing between them. I think they both need it.”\n",
      "“I’m going to be fine, you know.” He reaches across the center console\n",
      "for my hand, twining his fingers with mine, forcing a soft sigh from my lips. I\n",

      "More grounded. More myself. More confident.\n",
      "I’m more myself with Cade Eaton than I’ve ever been, and now I’ll have\n",
      "to wonder if he feels the same, or if he’s going through the motions out of a\n",

      "I give my eyes a petulant roll and mumble, “I know. I will,” before taking\n",
      "Violet’s hand and storming off. \n",
      "We go inside and up to my guest room, looking for some privacy while\n",
      "everyone else stands around outside and makes small talk.\n",
      "Violet flops on the mattress and announces, “Tell me everything.”\n",
      "I giggle and push my hair behind my ears, drawn to the window that\n",
      "overlooks the driveway. “About what?”\n",
      "“School? The city? What you wanna do this summer? Just . . . everything.\n",
      "I’m so happy there’s a girl here. This place stinks like boys \n",
      "all the time\n",
      ".”\n",
      "Out the window, I see the mystery boy shaking hands with my parents. I\n",
      "note the distaste on my father’s face. The pity on my mother’s.\n",
      "“Who’s the other guy?” I ask, unable to look away.\n",
      "“Oh.” Violet’s voice gets a little quiet. “That’s Jasper. He’s one of us\n",
      "now.”\n",
      "I turn to her, eyebrow quirked, hands on my hips, trying to play it cool,\n",
      "like I’m not \n",
      "too\n",
      " interested, but not really knowing how to achieve that either.\n",
      "“What do you mean?”\n",
      "She rolls up to sit cross-legged on the bed and shrugs. “He needed a\n",
      "family, so we took him in. I don’t know all the details. There was an accident.\n",
      "Beau brought him here one day last fall. I like to think of him as one more\n",
      "stinky brother. You can just think of him like a new cousin.”\n",
      "My head cants as my heart battles with my brain. My heart wants to stare\n",
      "out the window again, because Jasper is \n",
      "so \n",
      "cute and looking at him makes it\n",
      "do this weird little skipping thing in my chest.\n",
      "My brain knows it’s stupid, because if he’s friends with Beau, he must be\n",
      "at least fifteen.\n",
      "But I can’t stop myself.\n",
      "I look anyway.\n",
      "What I don’t realize is that I’ll be fighting the urge to stare at Jasper\n",
      "Gervais for years to come. Chapter One -Jasper\n",
      "Sloane Winthrop’s fiancé is a royal douchebag.\n",
      "I’m familiar with the type. You don’t work your way into the NHL\n",
      "without encountering your fair share.\n",
      "And this guy has the act down pat.\n",
      "As if the name \n",
      "Sterling Woodcock \n",
      "wasn’t enough of a giveaway, he’s\n",
      "now bragging about the hunting trip he and his dad spent hundreds of\n",
      "thousands of dollars on to kill lions born and bred in captivity, like that will\n",
      "somehow make their dicks bigger.\n",
      "From the Rolex on his wrist to his manicured nails, he’s practically\n",
      "dripping wealth, and I guess it only makes sense that Sloane might end up\n",
      "with a man like him. After all, the Winthrops are one of the most powerful\n",
      "families in the country with what is damn near a monopoly on the\n",
      "telecommunications industry.\n",
      "As he rambles, I glance at Sloane across the table. Her sky-blue eyes are\n",
      "downcast, and she’s clearly fiddling with the napkin in her lap. She looks like\n",
      "she’d rather be anywhere but here in this dimly lit, ornate steakhouse.\n",
      "And I feel about the same.\n",
      "Listening to her small-dicked future husband boast to a table full of\n",
      "family and friends I’ve never met about something that is honestly\n",
      "embarrassing—and sad—isn’t how I’d choose to spend a night off.\n",
      "But I’m here for Sloane, and that’s what I keep telling myself.\n",
      "Because seeing her right now, looking downtrodden mere nights before\n",
      "her wedding . . . it feels like she needs someone here who actually knows her.\n",
      "I expected her to be smiling. Glowing. I expected to feel happy for her—\n",
      "but I don’t.\n",
      "“You hunt, Jasper?” Sterling asks, looking all poised and pretentious.\n",
      "The collar of my checkered dress shirt immediately feels like it’s\n",
      "strangling me, even though the top buttons are undone. I clear my throat and\n",
      "roll my shoulders back. “I do.”\n",
      "Sterling picks up the crystal tumbler before him and leans back to assess\n",
      "me with a smug smirk on his perfectly shaved face. “Any big game? You’d\n",
      "enjoy a trip like this.” People who don’t know me nod and murmur their assent.\n",
      "“I don’t know if—” Sloane starts, but her fiancé steamrolls her attempt at\n",
      "adding anything to the conversation.\n",
      "“We all saw what your last contract came in at, so provided you’ve been\n",
      "responsible with your money, it’s definitely something you should be able to\n",
      "afford.”\n",
      "Like I said: douchebag.\n",
      "I bite the inside of my cheek, tempted to say I’ve been horribly\n",
      "irresponsible with my money and don’t have a dollar to my name. But as\n",
      "lowbrow as my upbringing might have been, I have enough class to know\n",
      "that finances aren’t polite dinner conversation.\n",
      "“Nah, man. I only hunt what I can eat and I’m unfamiliar with how to\n",
      "cook a lion.”\n",
      "A few chuckles break out around the table, including from Sloane. I don’t\n",
      "miss the quick moment where Sterling’s eyes narrow, where his teeth clamp,\n",
      "and his jaw pops.\n",
      "Sloane jumps in quickly, patting his arm like he’s a dog who needs\n",
      "soothing. “I used to hunt with my cousins out in Chestnut Springs too, you\n",
      "know?”\n",
      "I’m tossed back in time, remembering a young Sloane keeping up with\n",
      "the boys all summer. Sloane with dirt under her nails, scrapes on her knees,\n",
      "sun-bleached hair all tangled and free down her back.\n",
      "“It’s more about the thrill, you know? The power.” Sterling ignores\n",
      "Sloane’s comment entirely.\n",
      "He looks at me like an opponent, except we aren’t playing hockey right\n",
      "now. If we were, I’d be tempted to give him a quick blocker shot to the face.\n",
      "“Did you not hear what Sloane just said?” I’m trying to be cool, but I hate\n",
      "the way he’s treated her through this entire dinner.\n",
      "Sterling waves a hand and chuckles. “Ah yes. I’m always hearing about\n",
      "Wishing Well Ranch.” He turns to her with a condescending tone and a\n",
      "mocking smirk. “Well, thank goodness you outgrew whatever tomboy phase\n",
      "you went through, babe. You’d have missed your calling as a ballerina.”\n",
      "His shitty response is only made worse by my realization that he heard\n",
      "exactly what she said and \n",
      "chose \n",
      "to ignore her.\n",
      "“I can’t even imagine you handling a gun, Sloane!” one guy further down\n",
      "the long table exclaims, his nose a deep red from far too much scotch.\n",
      "“I was pretty good, actually. I think I only hit something alive once.” She laughs lightly and shakes her head, bright blonde strands of hair slipping\n",
      "down in front of her face before she pushes them back behind her ears and\n",
      "drops her eyes with a faint blush. “And then I cried inconsolably.”\n",
      "“I remember that day.” I glance across the table at her. “You couldn’t\n",
      "even eat the venison for dinner that night. We all tried to console you—it\n",
      "didn’t work.” My head shakes at the vivid walk down memory lane.\n",
      "“And that right there”—Sterling points at Sloane without even looking at\n",
      "her—“is why women don’t belong out hunting. Too upsetting.”\n",
      "      Sterling’s overgrown frat buddies guffaw at his lame comment, which\n",
      "urges him to go all in on his assholery. He holds his glass up high and looks\n",
      "down the table. “To keeping women in the kitchen!” \n",
      "      There’s laughter and a smattering of people offering “cheers” and\n",
      "“here here.”\n",
      "Sloane dabs the white cloth napkin over her full lips with a prim smile but\n",
      "keeps her eyes fixed on the empty place setting before her. Sterling goes back\n",
      "to gloating with the other guests—ignoring the woman sitting beside him.\n",
      "Ignoring the piece of herself she just tried to share with him. Ignoring the\n",
      "way he just embarrassed her.\n",
      "My patience for this night is quickly dwindling. The urge to slink into the\n",
      "background is overwhelming.\n",
      "Sloane catches my eye across the table and gives me one of her practiced\n",
      "smiles. I know it’s fake because I’ve seen her real smile.\n",
      "And this isn’t it.\n",
      "It’s the same smile she gave me when I told her I couldn’t go to prom\n",
      "with her as her date. Taking a twenty-three-year-old NHL player wasn’t\n",
      "appropriate for either of us, and I was the asshole who had to tell her that.\n",
      "I smile back, feeling frustration build inside me over the fact she’s about\n",
      "to tie herself to someone who treats her like an accessory, who doesn’t listen\n",
      "to her. Or appreciate that she’s layered and complex, and not just the polished\n",
      "princess she’s been molded into by her family.\n",
      "Sterling catches the exchange and turns his attention to me once again. It\n",
      "makes my skin crawl. “Sloane tells me you've been friends for a long time.\n",
      "Pardon my confusion, but a gruff hockey player doesn't seem like he'd be\n",
      "friends with a ballerina. Of course, I haven’t seen you around much since her\n",
      "and I got together. Something keeping you away?” He drapes an arm over her\n",
      "shoulder in a show of possession and I try not to fixate on the gesture.\n",
      "“To be fair, I haven’t heard much about you either.” I say it with enough humor in my tone that anyone missing the way we’re glaring might not even\n",
      "pick up on the jab. I lean back, crossing my arms over my chest. “But yeah. I\n",
      "guess I’m not too gruff to bring over Polysporin and painkillers when my\n",
      "friend’s feet are too raw from dancing in pointe shoes to even walk.” \n",
      "“I’ve told you this.” Sloane’s voice is placating. “He helped me move\n",
      "into my new condo. Sometimes we grab coffee. Simple little things like that.”\n",
      "“Basically, she knows if she needs something, I’ll be there,” I add,\n",
      "without thinking.\n",
      "Sloane shoots me a look, probably wondering why I’m acting like a\n",
      "territorial asshole. I’m wondering the same thing, to be honest.\n",
      "“Good thing you’ve got me for all that now.” Sterling is responding to\n",
      "Sloane, but he’s staring at me. Then he suddenly places a palm over Sloane’s\n",
      "hands in her lap. The ones still pulling at her napkin anxiously. But the way\n",
      "he touches her isn’t soothing or supportive. It’s a swat, a reproach for\n",
      "fidgeting.\n",
      "It sends fury racing through my veins. I need to get away before I do\n",
      "something I’ll really regret.\n",
      "“Well, I’m going to head out for the night,” I announce suddenly, pushing\n",
      "my chair back, desperate for fresh air and a break from the dark walls and\n",
      "velvet drapery pressing in around me.\n",
      "“Better get a good sleep in, Gervais. You’ll need it to get things rolling\n",
      "for the Grizzlies this season. After last season, you’re probably on thin ice.”\n",
      "I pull at the cuffs of my shirt and force myself to ignore the jab. “Thank\n",
      "you for inviting me, \n",
      "Woodcock\n",
      ". Dinner was delicious.”\n",
      "“Sloane invited you,” is his petulant reply, clarifying that he does not like\n",
      "me—or my presence.\n",
      "I stare down at him blankly and hitch one side of my mouth up. Like I\n",
      "can’t quite believe what a raging prick he is. I can feel eyes on us now, other\n",
      "people picking up on whatever unspoken tension is between us. “Well, that’s\n",
      "what friends are for.”\n",
      "“Wait, but you’re her cousin, right?” The drunk guy’s scotch spills over\n",
      "the rim of his tumbler and onto his hand as he points at me.\n",
      "I don’t know why Sloane and I have always been so adamant that we’re\n",
      "friends and not cousins. If someone tried to tell me that Beau, or Rhett, Or\n",
      "Cade wasn’t my brother, I’d write them off immediately. Those men \n",
      "are\n",
      " my\n",
      "brothers.\n",
      "But Sloane? She’s my friend. “Actually, he’s my friend, \n",
      "not\n",
      " my cousin.” Sloane tosses her napkin on\n",
      "the top of the white linen-covered table with more force than necessary.\n",
      "The people gathered for her wedding stare.\n",
      "Her wedding \n",
      "this weekend\n",
      ".\n",
      "My stomach twists.\n",
      "“You gonna be at the stag party tomorrow, Gervais?” the drunk guy\n",
      "continues. He hiccups and grins stupidly, reminding me of the drunk mouse\n",
      "at the Mad Hatter’s unbirthday party. “Would love to say I partied with\n",
      "hockey-superstar Jasper Gervais.”\n",
      "Color me surprised that the only reason a guy like this wants me around is\n",
      "to boost his perception.\n",
      "“Can’t. I’ve got a game.” My smile is tight, but my relief is immense as I\n",
      "rise from my chair.\n",
      "“I’ll walk you out,” Sloane pipes up, clearly missing the sharp look\n",
      "Sterling slices her way. Or maybe she’s just pretending she doesn’t notice.\n",
      "Either way, I hold one hand open and gesture Sloane ahead of me as we\n",
      "begin to weave our way silently across the restaurant.\n",
      "I go to press my palm against the small of her back to guide her through,\n",
      "but she tenses, and I jerk my hand away at the feel of smooth bare skin\n",
      "burning my fingertips. My eyes find the floor as I shove the tingling hand\n",
      "into my pocket, where it belongs.\n",
      "Because it sure as shit doesn’t belong on the bare back of an engaged\n",
      "woman.\n",
      "Even if she is just my friend. \n",
      "It’s only as we near the front of the restaurant that I look up again.\n",
      "Sloane’s slender frame sways as she strides across the room. Every\n",
      "movement steeped in an inherent grace—one that comes with years of\n",
      "training. Years of practice.\n",
      "She smiles politely at the maître d’ and then walks faster, like she can see\n",
      "freedom through that heavy front door and is desperate for it. Her shoulders\n",
      "drop and she pauses, almost in relief, when she rests both hands flat against\n",
      "the dark slab of wood.\n",
      "I watch her for a moment before I step up behind her, the heat of her body\n",
      "reaching out toward mine. Then I reach one arm above her petite frame and\n",
      "push the door open, ushering us both out into the cool November night.\n",
      "I jam both hands into the pockets of my slacks now so I don’t grab her\n",
      "shoulders and shake her, demanding to know what the hell she’s doing marrying a guy who treats her like Sterling Woodcock does. Because it’s\n",
      "really none of my business.\n",
      "Her toned, bare back is to me as she faces the busy city street, car lights a\n",
      "blur of white and red just beyond her, misty air puffing over her shoulder like\n",
      "she’s trying to catch her breath.\n",
      "“You okay?”\n",
      "Her head nods furiously before she turns back around with that weird\n",
      "Stepford wife smile plastered back on her dainty face.\n",
      "“You don’t look fine.” My fingers wrap around the keys in my pocket\n",
      "and jangle them anxiously.\n",
      "“Shit, thanks, Jas.”\n",
      "“I mean, you look beautiful,” I rush out, grimacing when I note her eyes\n",
      "widening. “You always do. You just don’t look . . . happy?”\n",
      "She blinks slowly, the edges of her mouth turning down into a slight\n",
      "frown. “Is that supposed to be better? Beautiful and unhappy?”\n",
      "God. I’m really blowing it. I rake a hand through my hair. “Are you\n",
      "happy? Does he make you happy?”\n",
      "Her mouth pops open in shock, and I know I’m out of line, or stepping in\n",
      "it, or whatever. But someone needs to ask her, and I doubt anyone has.\n",
      "I need to hear her say it.\n",
      "Her pale cheeks flush and her eyes narrow as she steps up to me, jaw\n",
      "tight. “You’re asking me this \n",
      "now\n",
      "?”\n",
      "I huff out a breath and run my top teeth almost painfully over my bottom\n",
      "lip, eyes totally fixed on her baby blues, so wide and pale and sparking with\n",
      "indignation. “Yeah. Has anyone else asked you?”\n",
      "She drops my gaze, her hands planting against her cheeks before pushing\n",
      "back through her collarbone-length blonde hair. “No one has asked me.”\n",
      "The teeth of my car key dig into the palm of my hand. “How did you\n",
      "meet Sterling?”\n",
      "“My dad introduced us.” Her eyes fixate on the black sky. It’s starless,\n",
      "not like at the ranch where you can see every little fleck of light. Everything\n",
      "in the city feels polluted compared to Chestnut Springs. I decide on the spot\n",
      "to drive out to my place in the country tonight rather than spend another night\n",
      "breathing the same air as Sterling Woodcock.\n",
      "“How does he know him?”\n",
      "Her eyes meet mine. “Sterling’s dad is a new business partner of his. He’s\n",
      "focused on making new connections now that he’s back in the city.” “And you’ve known this guy for how long again?”\n",
      "Her tongue darts out from between her lips. “We met in May.”\n",
      "“\n",
      "Five months\n",
      "?” My brow arches and I rear back. If they seemed madly in\n",
      "love I could buy it, but . . .\n",
      "“Don’t judge me, Jasper!” Her eyes flash and she steps closer again. I\n",
      "may dwarf her in height, but she’s not the least bit intimidated. She’s spitting\n",
      "mad right now. Mad at me. But I think that’s just because she trusts me\n",
      "enough to let her anger out, and I’m okay with letting her. I’m happy to be\n",
      "that person for her.\n",
      "Her voice shakes when she adds, “You have no idea the pressures I live\n",
      "with.”\n",
      "Without thinking twice, I pull her into my chest and wrap my arms\n",
      "around her narrow shoulders. She’s all tense and riled. I swear I can almost\n",
      "feel her vibrating with it. “I’m not judging you, Sunny.”\n",
      "Apparently, this isn’t the time for childhood nicknames.\n",
      "“Don’t call me that.” Her voice cracks as she presses her forehead to my\n",
      "chest, like she always has, and I slide my palm down the back of her hair,\n",
      "cupping the base of her skull.\n",
      "Like I always have.\n",
      "I absently wonder what Sterling would say if he walked out here right\n",
      "now. There’s a petty part of me that \n",
      "wants \n",
      "him to.\n",
      "“I’m just curious how things happened so fast. I’m curious why I’ve\n",
      "never met him until now.” My voice is quiet, all gravel, almost drowned out\n",
      "by the hush of cars rushing past us.\n",
      "“Well, it’s not like I have a lot of free time with the ballet. And it’s not\n",
      "like you’ve been in touch lately either.”\n",
      "Guilt nips at me, making my chest twist. Our team came off a bad season,\n",
      "and I promised myself I’d train harder than I ever have during the off-season.\n",
      "“I was training and living out in Chestnut Springs.” That’s not a lie. My\n",
      "brother’s fiancé opened a hell of a gym there, and I saw no reason to spend\n",
      "my summer in the city. “And then it was training camp, and I got swept up.”\n",
      "Also true.\n",
      "The lie is that I was too busy to make time for her. I could have made\n",
      "time for her. But I didn’t. Because I knew her dad was back in the city, and I\n",
      "avoid him at all costs.\n",
      "“I should have told you,” she murmurs.\n",
      "I swoop a hand over her head and give her shoulders a squeeze, still trying to avoid that warm, bare patch of skin on her back, and reply with, “I\n",
      "should have asked. I’ve just been . . . busy. I didn’t think your life would\n",
      "just . . . happen this fast.” And that part is true. Her engagement blindsided\n",
      "me.\n",
      "Her body relaxes in my arms, soft breasts pressing against my ribs as her\n",
      "fingers dig into my back. But only for a moment before she pulls away. The\n",
      "hug went on long enough that it was more of an embrace. It was toeing the\n",
      "line.\n",
      "But I still find myself wanting to pull her back in.\n",
      "“Well, it is.” She looks down and brushes at the sleeve of her pale green\n",
      "dress, silky and shimmering in the dark light. “My dad and I agreed it was\n",
      "best to move forward with the wedding in the fall rather than drawing it out.”\n",
      "That comment has my teeth clamping down, because the mere mention of\n",
      "Robert Winthrop sets me on edge. And him taking part in her decision to get\n",
      "married has all sorts of alarm bells going off.\n",
      "“Why?” My brow knits. I should know better. I should walk away. I\n",
      "should let her be happy.\n",
      "I shouldn’t be this bothered. Maybe if she actually seemed happy. I\n",
      "wouldn’t be.\n",
      "Or maybe I would.\n",
      "She waves a hand and glances over her shoulder into the restaurant,\n",
      "exposing her elegant neck as she does. “Multiple factors,” she replies with a\n",
      "defeated shrug. It’s like she knows her time with me is dwindling. I don’t get\n",
      "the sense that Sterling is going to be the type of husband that’s okay with her\n",
      "and I being friends.\n",
      "“Factors? Like you just can’t wait to be Mrs. \n",
      "Woodcock\n",
      "? Because no one\n",
      "wants that as a last name. Or is this your dad pressuring you?”\n",
      "Her blue eyes flare at the mention of her dad, because Sloane doesn’t see\n",
      "him as a snake. Never has. She’s too busy being the perfect daughter—and\n",
